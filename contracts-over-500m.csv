RM3702,Contract,"CROWN COMMERCIAL SERVICE",Closed,2015-10-19T13:13:04Z,"Merchant Acquiring Services","Crown Commercial Service (the Authority) is putting in place a Framework Agreement for use by UK public sector bodies identified at VI.3 (and any future successors to these organisations), which include Central Government Departments and their Arm’s Length Bodies and Agencies, Non Departmental Public Bodies, NHS bodies and Local Authorities.

The above public sector bodies have a need for merchant acquiring services, merchant acquiring equipment, and payment gateway services. 

The Services within the scope of this Framework Agreement have been sub-divided into 3 Lots:

Lot 1: A multi-Supplier Lot for the provision of merchant acquiring services and merchant acquiring equipment

Lot 2: A multi-Supplier Lot for the provision of merchant acquiring services and payment gateway services

Lot 3: A multi-Supplier Lot for the provision of merchant acquiring services, merchant acquiring equipment, and payment gateway services. 

This Framework Agreement will replace the existing Merchant Acquirer Service framework agreement (PS/09/93) which expires on 8th March 2016. The existing framework agreement is a single-supplier agreement for merchant acquiring services and merchant acquiring equipment. While Lot 1 of this Framework Agreement is similar in scope to the existing framework agreement, the scope of the Services available under Lot 2 and Lot 3 of this Framework Agreement are wider than the existing framework agreement in that payment gateway services will be included. In light of the increased scope of services, the Authority takes the view that it is unlikely that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (“TUPE”) will apply to this Framework Agreement or when any of the existing call-off contracts come to an end. The incumbent supplier has also confirmed that it does not believe TUPE will apply to this Framework Agreement or any resulting Call-Off Contracts as there is no organised grouping of employees dedicated to providing the services. Potential Providers are therefore required to bid on the basis that TUPE will not apply at Framework Agreement or call-off stage. 

Potential Providers are permitted to bid for all or any combination of the 3 Lots. However, in order to ensure that the Framework Agreement benefits from a diverse range of providers of payment gateway services, if a Potential Provider is awarded a Framework Agreement for Lot 3, the same Potential Provider will not be permitted to be awarded a Framework Agreement for Lot 2. 

Where a Potential Provider is successful in Lot 3 and has also submitted a Tender for Lot 2, the Potential Provider’s Tender for Lot 2 will be excluded from consideration for the Procurement for Lot 2.

The above Public Sector Bodies require a Framework Agreement that provides facilities management services. 

The Category's current position, in line with stakeholder engagement, is for a Lot structure that provides opportunities for regional as well as national providers.

The estimated value of the Framework Agreement, the Lot structure and Lot values will be confirmed within the OJEU publication, however it is anticipated that individual contract values will range from £500 and potentially up to £1.4Bn.

The purpose of the PIN is to:

1. Give advance notice that Crown Commercial Service (CCS) as the Contracting Authority, is to consider undertaking a tendering exercise to set up a new contracting vehicle to service Central Government and Wider Public Sector Organisations for their Facilities Management Services requirements.

In developing the Lot structure via market engagement CCS will consider a variety of contracting vehicles (e.g. framework(s), direct contracts and/or dynamic purchasing models for all or part of the requirement) in order to demonstrate a leaner sourcing approach and deliver greater value for money. Consideration is being given to the inclusion of specific defence and security requirements of MOD being incorporated within the framework that could be achieved via subsequent further competitions

2. Gauge the market interest in this procurement.

3. Identify suppliers who would like to participate in an Industry webinar to allow us to provide the market with an overview of the process CCS and partner organisations are looking to undertake. The webinar will be held on 19th May. The specific details of the webinar will be confirmed to suppliers that register with the CCS FM Team.

4. There will then be an industry boot camp, which will explain the business requirements and current procurement strategy in more detail and the intended outcome. This will provide an opportunity for suppliers to engage, ask questions and feedback. The industry boot camp will be held on 6th June. The location and timings will be confirmed to suppliers that register with the CCS FM Team.

To participate in the market engagement process please follow the instructions via the attached link http://ccs-agreements.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/node/6935/ This webpage is for the FM procurement, and will be updated during the process with presentation materials and further information for all suppliers to access.

The framework also includes alternative technology platforms for managing the customers' recruitment processes.

ESPO will impose on economic operators requirements aimed at protecting the confidential nature of information made available throughout the procurement procedure (as permitted by Regulation 21(3)) and, before receiving that information, economic operators will be required to complete & return a Confidentiality Agreement, which will be available once economic operators have expressed an interest in the tender opportunity.

Lot 1: Managed Service Provision - Service provision where one Managed Service Provider takes responsibility for delivering recruitment services on behalf of the Customer, as an alternative to the Customer managing a framework of individual Agencies. Managed Services can often involve the Managed Service Provider operating a 'tiered' structure of Agencies to deliver the Services, dependent on the service model provided.

Lot 2: Vendor Management System - For Customers who are looking for a technology solution to help them manage recruitment Agencies, either on a self-service basis where recruitment is devolved to Hiring Managers, or via their own internal recruitment team. The system used will help Customers to manage their supply chain, and interact with Agencies & Temporary Agency Workers through the system in regards to ordering, timesheet reconciliation, compliance & management information

Lot 3: Talent Pool Technology - For Customers who are looking for a Talent Pool Technology Platform that they can contract with directly and either include within their existing MSP delivery model or develop as a stand-alone solution. A Talent Pool Technology Platform is an online database which allows a Worker to register, create, maintain & delete their own profile and be matched automatically to jobs put forward through the platform by Hiring Managers. The Talent Pool Technology Platform will be available via desktop and/or app. As such, Tenders will only be accepted for Lot 3 from Tenderers who fulfil the Talent Pool Technology Core Specification. Tenderers for Lot 3 Talent Pool Technology will own the intellectual property rights (IPR) and development of the platform.

The framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months. The total estimated value stated includes the option period. An eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.

The DfE offsite framework is being established to cultivate innovation and modernise the industry by increasing the adoption of MMC (modern methods of construction) offsite production in the market, in line with the government's commitment to MMC and its presumption in favour of offsite construction by 2019 across suitable capital programmes, where it represents best value for money.
The DfE has appointed 5 contractors to each Lot. 
Lot 1 is intended for the delivery of offsite built Secondary Schools and Secondary blocks of Gross Internal Area (GIA) 6,000 m2 and above throughout England, but the DfE may use Lot 1 to deliver batches of primary school schemes. Schemes awarded under the framework will be subject to a mini competition or allocated via a performance based allocation procedure. The stated Lot value of 2 000 000 000 GBP is the maximum headroom for schemes delivered under this lot but the actual value of schemes is anticipated to be lower than this figure. The median anticipated pipeline for Lot 1 is expected to be a throughput of 15 secondary schemes per year. DFE makes no guarantee to any Bidder or contractor that they will be awarded any schemes and no guarantee is made in respect of any volume of work under the Framework Agreement.
Lot 2 is intended for the delivery of offsite built primary school schemes and secondary blocks of GIA from 750 to 6,000+ m2 throughout England, but the DfE may use Lot 2 to deliver secondary school schemes above 6,000 m2.

From service reviews and from locally led change through sustainability and transformation plans, we expect there to be more networks of specialist providers and re-shaping supply models and contracting approaches to integrate care around patients. Service reviews will also provide opportunity for providers to propose sustainable solutions in line with clinically developed requirements. Service review implementation will also enable new payment approaches in order to incentivise improvement in care quality and patient experience. Where the relationship between quality, value and patient volumes is strong we expect there to be consolidation of some services as a consequence of undertaking reviews.

The Cabinet Office has set a Common Minimum Standards policy for the Procurement of Built Environments in the Public Sector across Government, with which this proposed Framework will adhere to provide economically advantageous tenders.
 ProCure22 is a National Framework Agreement for England between the Department of Health (DH) and Principal Supply Chain Partners (framework suppliers) under which a range of capital investment construction schemes can be delivered to DH, its sub-departments in the NHS, the NHS Authorities and Trusts and any other Local Authority health and social care related facility in England. Under the Framework, Contracting Authorities may also participate in jointly funded schemes to fulfil their statutory duties.
 The capital investment schemes for the NHS largely consist of the build of clinical and specialist facilities (i.e. community hospitals, cardio-thoracic units, mental health facilities et al) and from master planning through design to completion of build and handover of any capital investment required to meet the strategic business objectives of the DH, NHS or other organisations delivering Health or Social Care. The Framework is intended to inspire and support operator initiatives such as investment in sustainability, carbon management, power sourcing and usage as well as DH/NHS efficiency and productivity initiatives such as the Carter Programme.
 The Framework requires the creation and maintenance of accredited, stable and integrated supply chains that encourages and enables the delivery of strategic planning, design and construction effort needed to deliver DH and NHS policy objectives.",,,"Any region","45000000 ",,supplier.helpdesk@dh.gsi.gov.uk,"Skipton House, 80 London Road",,London,"SE1 6LH",England,"+44 2079722000",https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-health,"P22 Industry Day Question and Answers.xlsx P22 High Level Requirements.pdf ",,"Interested parties are invited to attend a supplier event as part of pre-tender market engagement.

The maximum initial duration of any Call-Off Contract that may be placed by an eligible Contracting Authorities is 24 months with two extensions allowed, each of up to 12 months.
G-Cloud services, available via the Digital Marketplace, will require frequent procurement refreshes to bring on new suppliers and services. New iterations of this Framework are being considered at a frequency of 12 months depending on demand and/or availability of new services as the IT Cloud market develops.

Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, Crown Commercial Service (CCS) believes that the first condition set out in Regulation 72(1)(c) Public Contracts Regulations 2015 has been fulfilled in respect of the Framework Agreement.

Crown Commercial Service has taken the decision to extend existing framework agreements that were due for re procurement for a period of up to three months (3 months) for G-Cloud 12. This is to enable CCS resources to be diverted to procuring urgent requirements to deal with COVID-19 consequences and to relieve pressure on the supply chain while short staffed, to enable businesses to continue to deliver services and goods to customers.

From service reviews and from locally led change through sustainability and transformation plans, we expect there to be more networks of specialist providers and re-shaping supply models and contracting approaches to integrate care around patients. 

Service reviews will also provide an opportunity for providers to propose sustainable solutions in line with clinically developed requirements. Service review implementation will also enable new payment approaches in order to incentivise improvement in care quality and patient experience. 

Where the relationship between quality, value and patient volumes is strong we expect there to be consolidation of some services as a consequence of undertaking reviews. 
NHS England will continue to undertake reviews using a structured programme methodology with provider selection carried out in an open and transparent way. There are already a number of services out for procurement at this time. 

NHS England Wessex Commissioning Hub is signalling their intent to: 
• award whole contracts for 2017-2019 using the NHS Standard Contract to the incumbent providers without further publication, unless; expressions of interest are received from alternative economic operators 
• explore the opportunities for longer than 2 year contracts where this affords opportunities for significant improvements in service quality and efficiency facilitated by using the NHS Standard Contract option to extend the term for up to two years 

The closing date for expressions of interest is 5pm on Friday 4th November 2016. 

Economic operators should express interest in writing to https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/ProjectManage/281 . During this contract period, where services may be subject to further procurement as a result of the rolling Strategic Service Review Programme, procurements will be published appropriately.

PECS provides a critical function to a range of Criminal Justice System (CJS) stakeholders including the Police, Courts, Prisons and Youth Custody Services. The contract will be split into 2 lots, Lot N: North East, North West, Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside and Wales, Lot S: East of England, London, South East and South West.
PECS4 contractors will continue to physically transport  prisoners between locations but increasingly the requirement will be to enable and support changes to the core operating model for courts, prisons and the police
resulting from the implementation of MoJ reform programmes, including an increased proportion of business being delivered in a virtual environment with greater emphasis on the use of video technology. PECS contractors will be responsible for the movement of adult males and females from prisons and police stations to courts as well as, inter-prison transfers, the movement of children and young people from Young Offender Institutions (YOIs), Secure Training Centres (STCs) and Secure Children's Homes (SCHs) as well as care and security whilst in the court custody area and in the dock, and transfers from courts to prisons and other nominated locations at the conclusion of court business.
The services will include:
- Escorting of adults and children and young people,
- At Court Care and Security,
- Inter Prison Transfers,
- Bedwatches for Children and Young People,
- Prisoner Welfare,
- Tornado and Mutual Aid,
- Incident Management,
- Audit and Quality Assurance.
Each service component (adult and children and young people) will be separately specified, funded and managed.
The anticipated quantity or scope is an estimate of the potential value of the contracts and does not in any way
guarantee any level of expenditure. The estimated cost range is real in 2018, does not account for inflation and
includes any possible future changes to the requirement for services as listed in additional information of this PIN. All values should be considered as indicative only.
The award criteria will be based on the most economically advantageous tender. Potential providers will be able to bid for both lots but will only be allowed to win 1 of the lots, unless there is only one bidder across both lots, in which case both lots could be awarded to 1 bidder. Potential providers will be required to state within their response to the Selection Questionnaire (SQ) the lots they want to bid for. If potential providers bid for both lots, they must be prepared to be awarded a contract for either lot, and must not state a preference. Variant bids will not be permitted.",,,"North East,North West,Yorkshire and The Humber,East Midlands,West Midlands,East of England,London,South East,South West,Wales","75231220 ",,PECS_4_Competition@justice.gov.uk,"102 petty France",,London,"SW1H 9AJ",England,,www.gov.uk/government/organisations/justice,,,"
1)Type of procedure:
The services being awarded are listed within Schedule 3 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR) and

with negotiation and will comply with its obligations of equal treatment, transparency, non-discrimination and
proportionality at all times during the procurement.
2) Objective criteria for choosing the number of candidates:
Maximum of 5 bidders for each lot will be invited to participate in the negotiation phase of the procurement
process following assessment of initial bids. Details of the objective criteria for selecting shortlisted bidders will
be set out in the procurement documents. Where the top 5 ranked bidders cannot be identified due to 2 or more
bidders being ranked in 5th place, the Authority will take through all equally ranked bidders at this rank. If all
potential providers elect to bid for both lots, the maximum number of bidders to be shortlisted will be 5. Where the top 5 ranked bidders cannot be identified due to 2 or more bidders being ranked in 5th place, the Authority
will take through all equally ranked bidders at this rank.
3) Economic and financial assessment
Economic and Financial assessment will form part of the Selection Questionnaire on a Pass / Fail basis.
The Authority will be requesting updates to the information throughout the negotiation phase and should the
criteria set out in the 6.1.4.2 of the SQ Information and Background, not be met, the Authority will exclude
Potential Providers from the process. Further details of the Authority's approach are set out in the Selection
Questionnaire.

The Contracting Authority as defined in VI.3 is seeking to establish a multi-supplier Framework Agreement for up to 10 years. The Framework Agreement will enable the award of call-off contracts for the development of sites identified by the Contracting Authority for delivery through the formation of a Joint Venture vehicle (JV). In forming any such JV, a Supplier will be required to provide or procure the provision of funding for the development, provide development management services and, potentially, provide or procure the provision of related ancillary works and services to the Contracting Authority. The Contracting Authority has a need to develop a selection of sites that it owns in the Capital to maximise the economic value of those sites back to the Contracting Authority, in order to increase revenue. The sites vary in size and readiness for development and include, but are not limited to, buildings that offer the potential for residential conversion, mixed use or residential developments, major regeneration schemes in town centres, brownfield developments in inner and outer London and land attached to, adjacent to or over stations, depots, railways, highways, bus or other operational property and transport infrastructure. The Framework Agreement will provide the Contracting Authority with the ability to partner with Suppliers for the purposes of developing sites identified by the Contracting Authority for delivery in joint venture and obtain the benefit of the Suppliers' services and provision by Suppliers of ancillary works and services (being those which are ancillary to the relevant development). The scope of the Contracting Authority's requirements through the Framework Agreement is expected to cover all or any part of a property development cycle and will include, but not be limited to, development management services including planning services, site surveying, scheme design and specification, construction design and management, community and stakeholder management, site valuation, development appraisals, marketing, programme management and construction implementation strategy. A Supplier awarded a call-off contract may be required to supply the services either directly to the relevant Contracting Authority or to the relevant site JV. The JV may also be required to supply works or services directly to the relevant Contracting Authority In addition to providing these services, Suppliers may also be required to provide further services related to the development of proposals to develop sites including, but not limited to, the development of detailed business plans (including development appraisals) and the development of and implementation of funding strategies as part of any call-off contract.

These legacy contracts and activities vary and will be incrementally included into Selborne over the Contract Term. The Authority may incorporate all or part of the legacy contracts and/or in-house service provision.
      The Authority intends to bring the legacy contracts and in-house service provision together into a single Contract to enable the Authority to transfer the management of such training services to a single Contractor and for the Contractor to improve Value for Money for the Authority, by exploiting commonality, coherence and synergies between training services to improve the quality and efficiency of service provision, and by giving the Contractor more scope to identify and implement opportunities for improvements and modernisation across wider Maritime Training.

The Authority has developed a set of Critical Success Factors (CSFs) which are aligned with its strategic objectives. The CSFs underpin the procurement programme and will help the Authority to achieve its future vision and are as follows:

-	Managing our risks: the continued success of Nest must have trust at its core.  Our customers need to trust that we can effectively look after their data and assets. It is vital that we can manage a smooth transition into our new scheme administration service and that once we are live, that service is robust and secure.
-	Enabling a commercially sustainable Nest: we are ultimately funded by our members.  Our new service must be delivered in a commercially efficient way that seeks to align our commercial interests, supports the long-term financial forecasts for the scheme and enables opportunities to maintain and grow sustainable revenue streams. 
-	Securing value for money:  We need to scope our services to fit the needs of our customers and deliver value for money over the life of the services including exit. We must run a competitive and legally compliant procurement. 
-	Improving customer outcomes: our vision is to help millions enjoy a better retirement.  Our new scheme administration services must focus on how advances in technology and deep data analytics ensure a joined up approach to continuous improvement and excellence in customer service.  This is so that we can help all of our customers to make the right choices and drive better outcomes.
-	Delivering services consistent with our values and capabilities: Nest is underpinned by the values of transparency, ease, empowerment and respect.  We want our future services to develop in alignment with these and work with a partner that understands 'what makes Nest, Nest' and can provide expertise that complements the capabilities that already sit within our organisation.",10/11/2020,09/11/2038,17/06/2019,NO,,No,No,No,Services,1500000000,0,,,,,,,"CompetitiveDialogueOJEU ",

PROACTIS Reference - NECSPrTe1000051

In 2016/17 NHS England set out our approach to ensure that prescribed specialised services are commissioned from the most capable providers through a rolling Strategic Service Review Programme with priorities published in commissioning intentions. 

From service reviews and from locally led change through sustainability and transformation plans, we expect there to be more networks of specialist providers and re-shaping supply models and contracting approaches to integrate care around patients. 

Service reviews will also provide opportunity for providers to propose sustainable solutions in line with clinically developed requirements. Service review implementation will also enable new payment approaches in order to incentivise improvement in care quality and patient experience.

Where the relationship between quality, value and patient volumes is strong we expect there to be consolidation of some services as a consequence of undertaking reviews. NHS England will continue to undertake reviews using a structured programme methodology with provider selection carried out in an open and transparent way. There are already a number of services out for procurement at this time.

NHS England - North West is signalling our intent to:
•	award whole contracts for 2017-2019 using the NHS Standard Contract 
•	to the incumbent providers without further publication, unless; expressions of interest are received from alternative economic operators 
•	explore the opportunities for longer than 2 year contracts where this affords opportunities for significant improvements in service quality and efficiency  facilitated by using the NHS Standard Contract option to extend term for upto two years 

Economic operators should express interest via the PROACTIS portal - https://supplierlive.proactisp2p.com/Account/Login 
During this contract period, where services may be subject to further procurement as a result of the rolling Strategic Service Review Programme, procurements will be published appropriately.

agreement for the provision for New Build Construction Works.
Islington Council is seeking to appoint the highest 8 (eight) scoring contractors per lot to the
framework agreement. Contracts based on the framework agreement shall follow the terms of
the framework agreement including how a contract is concluded. How a contract is concluded
is explained within the invitation to tender documentation.
The framework agreement will utilise both direct award and mini-competitions to award to those
contractors successful on the framework.
The framework agreement can also be accessed and used by the London Borough of Hackney
and the London of Camden (participating authorities). The participating authorities can access
the framework agreement by entering into an access agreement with the London Borough of
Islington
Background and Description
The Council wishes to establish a framework agreement of contractors to enable it to
commission construction, refurbishment and associated works as and when required, on a
design and build basis and/or an intermediate with design basis and/or and intermediate without
design basis.
The framework agreement aims to attract and engage with contractors that are experienced in
new build refurbishment, repairs and maintenance work across different sectors including
residential, education, health, community and mixed use schemes to maximise the opportunity
for the Council to deliver best value.
The bulk of the work that will be procured via this framework will be for residential mixed tenure
new build projects. This could include refurbishment or conversion schemes that will be
procured either as part of a combined new build/refurbishment/conversion schemes or on a
stand-alone basis.
The scope of the works covered by the framework agreement shall include residential and non residential
new build projects. Works may cover new build/refurbishment/conversion works also
to education, health, third sector or other community buildings as well as non-residential
elements on a stand-alone basis or as a mixed use scheme if deemed appropriate by the
Council.
The scope will also cover roof top extensions and all construction works associated with this
type of development including, where considered appropriate, works to existing related
building/asset fabric, infrastructure or finishes to maximise the benefits and value for money to
the Council of such combined work and to mitigate the extent and duration of any
inconvenience to residents.
The Council is keen to promote the use of modern methods of construction under where it can
deliver benefits in value for money, quality, health, safety and mitigate inconvenience to
residents.",,,London,"45000000 ","Nuria Carrascosa",nuria.carrascosa@islington.gov.uk,"7 Newington Barrow Way",,London,"N7 7EP",England,"+44 2075278118",http://www.islington.gov.uk/,,,,01/10/2019,30/09/2023,07/05/2019,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Works,1200000000,1200000000,,,,,,,"Restricted ",

The procurement is using a bespoke approach similar to a competitive procedure with negotiation. In order to take part in the first round of negotiation meetings, potential bidders must notify the CCG of their intent to take part no later than 4pm on Tuesday 22 January 2019. Register at https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home.

The service will begin on 1 April 2020. The Contract will be for a period of up to 10 years. The indicative budget is £105m per annum. The CCG wants to ensure consistency across the geography. The CCG defines this as one provider delivering at least 85% of the Contract value itself.

The Contract will cover all core adult community health services, focusing on four overarching service specifications:

•	Integrated locality teams focusing on relationships with primary care through regular multidisciplinary team meetings to support people who have relatively stable needs to manage and reduce the risk of acute worsening of their condition. Access to community services will be through a single point of access.  
•	Urgent and reactive care teams working across localities to manage people who have acutely worsening conditions. This includes rapid response and has links to secondary care and community beds.  
•	Specialist advice and support has clinical staff knowledgeable about specific conditions such as diabetes and heart failure. There is an expectation that the community service will strengthen links between secondary care and primary care and ensure that patients, carers and professionals are empowered to better understand and manage the condition.  
•	Locality hubs are provided through physical building(s) and/or virtual connections of professionals within a locality that give people and professionals across a larger area access to services to support wellbeing and promote prevention and self-management. 
These four groupings combine services according to the level of complexity of people they support, all designed to help people to stay in the community.

The CCG wants to ensure a safe transfer of services so that from the start of the contract patients and carers experience as a minimum the same level of service that they have been receiving, with no gaps in provision. The Provider needs to become a long-term system partner, providing person-centred care, working closely with primary care leadership and being flexible to transition towards more integrated and innovative working during the life of the contract. The Provider needs to be part of Healthier Together, the Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP), work towards implementing the STP vision for an integrated care system and be willing to be part of a provider alliance with primary care localities.",,,"South West","85323000 ","Michael Pingstone",Michael.pingstone@nhs.net,"c/o NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group,","South Plaza, Marlborough St",Bristol,BS13NX,England,01179841614,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home,,"https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home ","This Contract Notice follows a Prior Information Notice released on 10th September 2018 and two market engagement events for potential bidders in 2018.

        Event 2 - to be held in Cyprus on 10th September 2019 
        
        As part of the selection stage of the competition, for each Regional Sub-Lot, bidders will be required to provide evidence of technical and professional capability by demonstrating previous experience of acting as Principal Contractor in the relevant region, in addition to demonstrating the capability to deliver the scope of the requirements within the Lot and Regional Sub-Lot(s).

The Mayor also wants the energy market to work better for Londoners, delivering fairer prices, helping them reduce their energy use and make the best use of smart innovations. The GLA procurement is open to innovative ideas that will deliver its desired outcomes and wants to establish a genuine collaboration with a company or consortium to achieve them. 
The Contracting Authorities seek to procure a fully licensed energy supplier to offer the supply of gas and electricity to all of London's residents using branding set up by the GLA under the Mayor of London's Energy for Londoners programme; and to undertake Voids Services for London Boroughs (LBs) and Housing Associations (HAs).

The key eight objectives are:
1. Competitively priced electricity and gas tariffs
2. Customer service and branding: Exemplary customer satisfaction 
3. Innovation: Innovating to help Londoners and especially those in fuel poverty to better meet their energy needs and budget for them.
4. Integration with other energy programmes
5. Data access: Provide access to all EfLSCo customer consumption data, for the GLA, LBs, contractors and research partners.
6. Financial: Generate a commission, without affecting the competitive viability of tariff structures.
7. Support the possible future transition to a fully licensed supplier or to another Service Provider.
8. Void Services: Support handling vacant properties, including installation of smart meters during void periods.

The Contracting Authorities are setting up a four (4) year Framework Agreement. The EfLSCo scheme will be delivered via a Call-Off from the Framework Agreement based on a four-year term, with the option for an extension or extensions of up to four more years. The LBs and HAs detailed may enter into Call-Off Contracts under the Framework Agreement for Voids Services. 
The procurement will follow the Competitive Dialogue procedure (under PCR 2015) to allow for the agreement scope and commercial arrangements to be developed and negotiated during the process, using an outcome based specification.  During this process, comments will be invited on draft framework and call-off contracts at Initial Tender.  Upon issue with the Final Tender, Framework and call-off contracts final terms must be accepted.
Securing and management of the EfLSCo customers will be handled by the Service Provider, and all interactions will be performed by the Service Provider's staff. The estimated turnover that the Service Provider would be able to generate across the four-year term is of the order of £279 million, including Voids Services.  If the GLA choose to extend the call-off arrangement for a further four years an additional £713 million estimated turnover may be realised. All numbers are estimates and are not guaranteed by GLA and assumptions associated with customers acquired are set out in the procurement documents.",,,London,"09000000 65000000 44161110 71314200 71314300 ","Nadeem Iftikhar",NadeemIftikhar@tfl.gov.uk,"55 Broadway",,LONDON,"SW1H 0BD",England,,https://tfl.gov.uk,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=f559b8b6-d152-e811-80eb-005056b64545&fromProjectDashboard=True ","

Procurement and Legal Considerations

For the reasons set out above, the CCG plans to enter into a contract directly with the Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, East London Foundation Trust and the City and Hackney GP Confederation for a Neighbourhood Health and Care Alliance service.  However, the CCG requests that any other providers who would genuinely be capable and interested in providing the Neighbourhood Health and Care Alliance service within the CCG's desired timescales as described above submit an expression of interest by the 4 November 2019.    This will help inform the CCG's decision as to whether it will proceed with its proposed direct award. 

If the CCG receives no expressions of interest by the 4 November 2019, the CCG plans to award a contract under the provisions of Regulation 32(2)(b)(ii) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 and Regulation 5 of the National Health Service (Procurement, Patient Choice and Competition) Regulations (No.2) 2013.  For the avoidance of doubt, the receipt of expressions of interest from third parties shall not commit the CCG to carry out any further tender process, nor shall this notice constitute a formal call for competition under the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or the National Health Service (Procurement, Patient Choice and Competition) Regulations (No.2) 2013.

Description of Procurement
The scope of the ASDOT programme currently covers provision of live flying assets to meet the following training requirements:-
• Air to Air Combat
• Air to Surface Combat
• Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC)/Forward Air Controller (Airborne) (FAC(A))
• Electronic Warfare
• Air Traffic Control (ATC), Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD) and Aerospace Battle Management (ABM)
• Live Gunnery
The ASDOT team is currently working towards an Investment Decision by the end of 2016. Under current plans, a competition for this requirement under the Negotiated Procedure will be launched with the release of a Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ). At this time it is envisaged that a single 15 year contract will be let covering the delivery of the requirement through a phased approach. It is important to the Authority that as many interested parties be given the opportunity to understand and consider ASDOT ahead of formal engagement and therefore an Industry Day is planned, at a date to be advised, this will be an opportunity for potential suppliers to learn more about the requirement document.
Some Industry engagement has already taken place during the Concept Phase through the Niteworks Partnership and the Authority now invites companies wishing to learn more about this requirement or offer views on contract duration, phasing and performance measures, technology insertion points and capability enhancements, to contact the Project Team which would be happy to engage.
This PIN is to alert the market to this potential future requirement and is NOT a formal request for Expressions of Interest (EOI). A Contract Notice and Dynamic PQQ may be issued at a date after the Industry Day to request EOIs which shall reference this PIN. 
Enquiries should be sent by email to: DESUKMFTS-ASDOT-Cmrcl-Industry@mod.uk

 The in-service support packages available are: RFA WAVE KNIGHT, RFA WAVE RULER, RFA FORT AUSTIN, RFA FORT ROSALIE, RFA FORT VICTORIA (Lot 1) - Estimated value £320M over ten (10) year contract duration; RFA LYME BAY, RFA MOUNTS BAY, RFA CARDIGAN BAY, RFA ARGUS, HMS SCOTT (Lot 2) - Estimated value £275M over ten (10) year contract duration; and / or RFA TIDESPRING, RFA TIDERACE , RFA TIDESURGE, RFA TIDEFORCE (Lot 3) - Estimated value £345M over ten (10) year contract duration, which will include but not be limited to: worldwide engineering support; rectification of Operational Defects; and the planning, management and implementation of maintenance periods. Maintenance periods may include, but not be limited to: Refit Periods; Docking Periods; Contractor Support Periods; Annual Certification Periods; and Assisted Maintenance Periods.
- The successful bidder will also be required to provide design, planning, implementation and technical services for the various update, upgrade and / or modification packages along with the global supply and transport of spares.

A joint team (the Authority and the successful bidder) will be co-located at the successful bidder's premises and work collaboratively with other CSS support. It is envisioned that there will be one (1) joint support team per Lot.

The contract will be for ten (10) years, with a value for money exercise commencing at the three and a half (3.5) year point. The Authority will have the option, at its sole discretion, to break the contract at the five (5) year point if it believes value for money is not being achieved.
Years one (1) to five (5) will be firm price i.e. not subject to variation, and years six (6) to ten (10) will be fixed price, subject to the price index / indices stated in the contract. The justification for the proposed framework duration is that RFA and OSV vessels require a refit period every five (5) years, and a ten (10) year framework will allow for two (2) refit periods within one contractual agreement which will provide benefits to both the successful bidder and Authority through learning for experience. Planning a refit period requires eighteen (18) months, and a seven (7) year contract period would risk interruption to the planning or delivery of a second refit period. Certification is required at a docking every five (5) years so a ten (10) year framework would afford full certification twice preventing the risk of uncertified and therefore unusable vessels in the fleet. This is therefore deemed as exceptional circumstances.

No work whatsoever is guaranteed under any resulting framework agreement or contract and there is no guarantee that any framework agreement or contract will be put in place in relation to this notice.

      The United Kingdom Ministry of Defence is considering an exciting opportunity to revise the approach to contracting expertise in support of Digital & ICT Roles. The intention is to select a number of suppliers onto a Flexible Delivery Partner Framework (FDPF) covering all D&IT capability and expertise required to deliver MOD Digital IT Programs and transformation for the next three to five years.
      
      The new framework will be a multi-lot framework that has a number of suppliers per lot to deliver a wide range of capability and expertise to MoD. The MoD will define the lot and initial capability required but will not constrain what capability suppliers can put forward as long as it fits with the capability family under the specific lot. It is anticipated that suppliers may be successful across multiple lots resulting in an estimated six to nine strategic delivery partners.
      
      The estimated value of throughput on this framework is up to £300M per year, with an initial 3-year contract duration (with possible options for extension) under consideration. The option periods are also estimated up to a value of £300M per year, with a potential future value over the life of the contract of £1.5bn.

From service reviews and from locally led change through sustainability and transformation plans, we expect there to be more networks of specialist providers and re-shaping supply models and contracting approaches to integrate care around patients. 

Service reviews will also provide an opportunity for providers to propose sustainable solutions in line with clinically developed requirements. Service review implementation will also enable new payment approaches in order to incentivise improvement in care quality and patient experience. 

Where the relationship between quality, value and patient volumes is strong we expect there to be consolidation of some services as a consequence of undertaking reviews. 
NHS England will continue to undertake reviews using a structured programme methodology with provider selection carried out in an open and transparent way. There are already a number of services out for procurement at this time. 

NHS England South East Commissioning Hub is signalling their intent to: 
• award whole contracts for 2017-2019 using the NHS Standard Contract to the incumbent providers without further publication, unless; expressions of interest are received from alternative economic operators 
• explore the opportunities for longer than 2 year contracts where this affords opportunities for significant improvements in service quality and efficiency facilitated by using the NHS Standard Contract option to extend the term for up to two years

The initial priorities will be to offer good quality cost effective residential care to meet the needs of Looked After Children (LAC) with complex behaviours and disabilities and to provide additional capacity to enhance edge of care services. The CPS covers the whole care system from point of entry in Children's Services to leaving care and aims to manage demand and provide the most cost effective placement and support services that deliver the best outcomes for children and young people. The Council wishes to enter into a collaboration agreement with an organisation or lead organisation acting for a consortium that can both design and deliver innovative services that provide improved outcomes for Leicestershire young people on the edge of care through to leaving care including children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND). The CIP will include 3 stages: design, delivery and evaluation. The Council expects the Partner to be able to bring its own financial or in kind contribution to the design stage and to the delivery stage to enhance the Councils statutory requirements in providing services to LAC and children with SEND. The Partner must have both the capacity to provide high quality advice and deliver major change in children's services. It is expected that the Partner will have the experience, expertise and quality standards to deliver the majority of services designed by the CIP and therefore must have a proven track record in providing children's services for edge of care, fostering, adoption, and permanence and care leavers. The estimated maximum annual value is £70,400,000 this is based on the 2018/19 budgets for the services covered by the CIP. The estimated maximum total value is £704,000,000 over 10 years. It is not intended that the full budget for each service area will be spent through the CIP. The Council will continue to use existing contracts and frameworks to purchase services. The scope and cost for each service delivered through the CIP will be agreed between the Council and the Partner as part of the design stage and will be within the budget envelope for existing services.

Feedback to ESPO suggests that these customers would often rather a fixed price solution as this could provide multiple benefits; budgetary certainty across a fixed time period, decreased exposure to market forces such as oil pricing, and an increased flexibility of options when approaching the market for their energy requirement.

The fleet includes (but is not limited to) cars, vans, heavy goods vehicles, motorbikes, bicycles (approximately 2 000 assets in addition to the 5 300 assets mentioned above), plant (and equipment), and all in asset equipment' allocated to a vehicle/asset. The current Fleet Services team is made up of a combination of in house and outsourced capabilities providing a mix of services to MPS in order to keep the fleet in full operation at all times. Services are provided to and between a number of sites and locations within the Greater London Area and to a non-exhaustive list of locations outside the Greater London Area. The overall strategy for Fleet Services is to support MPS in achieving MOPAC's Police and Crime Plan and to provide a flexible and scalable solution that meets the future operational demands for fleet. The primary objective of Fleet Services is to provide MPS with the right fleet assets at the right time, in the right place, and in the most cost effective way. In order to achieve the above strategy, MOPAC, as the contracting authority, is tendering for the supply of a new Fleet Services solution to the MPS. Upon completion of the tendering process, MOPAC hopes to award a contract to a suitably capable contractor to provide Fleet Services for an initial term of 96 months. MOPAC will have a unilateral option to extend the contract for further periods up to a maximum of 48 months. To ensure that MPS receives the benefit of the contractors expertise, it is envisaged that the contract will give the successful contractor the freedom to provide the Services in the manner that it sees fit as long as the contractor complies with the service requirements and specifications outlined in the contract. The MPS will retain the right to source assets itself where it considers that the MPS will be able to obtain better value for money than the successful contractor. The exact requirements for numbers and specifications of vehicles will vary over time in accordance with operational demands. The contract will include flexible change mechanisms to enable the MPS to update specifications and volume requirements as needed in order to enable operational policing. Depending on the solution offered by the Contractor, the MPS may transfer ownership of existing MPS assets to the Contractor and/or the Contractor may take over management of existing MPS leased assets. The MPS is interested in exploring solutions under which the Contractor will own and/or provide finance for some or all of the assets provided under the contract. The scope of the contract awarded under this procurement process may also involve the provision of the supplies and/or services to the functional bodies of the Greater London Authority, including Transport for London (TfL), The Greater London Authority (GLA) and The London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) (which runs the London Fir",,"SW6 1TR",London,"34300000 34200000 34100000 50100000 60180000 60170000 42415320 35200000 34400000 ","Mr Joe Stevens",,"Floor 8"," Empress State Building",,"SW6 1TR",,,,,,,13/11/2015,13/11/2027,13/03/2015,NO,,No,No,No,Works,600000000,700000000,,,,,,,"Open ",

The Ministry intends to establish a multi-participant framework agreement. The agreement will operate on the basis that orders will be placed (following a mini-tender) and the successful supplier will act as Principal Contractor with single point of responsibility for the management and delivery of a specific project at 1 (or more) MOD establishment(s) located within South West England. The Framework Agreement will be for a period of 4 years, with options to extend for up to a further 3 years, taken at the discretion of the Ministry. Other UK Contracting Authorities (as referred to in VI.3) with requirements for the types of works & services referred to in this notice and which may be classified as sensitive works or sensitive services within the scope of Directive 2009/81/EC may subject to the exact nature of their requirement (and in particular subject to it falling within the scope of the said directive) and subject to the prior approval of the Ministry, call off the framework.
The successful supplier appointed under each call off from the Framework Agreement, will be responsible for co-ordinating and integrating the activities of their supply chain including consultants, subcontractors and suppliers and performing all tasks necessary to achieve the stated requirements and demonstrate fitness for purpose. The framework agreement will include delivery of such services related to the construction of new buildings and facilities, refurbishment of existing buildings and infrastructure work as the Ministry may require. It is envisaged that detailed design will normally be included for projects procured through the Framework Agreement. Some projects may require the successful supplier to undertake the entirety of the design process, including the development and completion of the full design and all work associated with planning applications. Maintenance of completed projects may be required during a ""compliance period"" to establish that performance in accordance with anticipated design parameters is being achieved. The specific projects that may be procured under the Framework Agreement cannot be clearly defined at this stage but the principal intention is that it shall be generally available for use for procuring projects up to the approximate value of GBP 12 000 000 at the discretion of the Ministry but there shall be no exclusivity nor any guaranteed volume of work.

The service user support services will include the provision of:

Accommodation
Accommodation is provided to support asylum applicants and their dependents who would otherwise be destitute. Accommodation is to be provided by the service provider(s) covering a number of regions in the UK. Accommodation provision is through local authorities, private and other accommodation providers e.g. housing associations. Accommodation is paid for on the basis of usage only, with the provider taking the void risk.
Three types of accommodation services required are:
1.	Initial accommodation where a destitute asylum applicant and their dependents will reside before a decision is made on their support claim. 
2.	Dispersal accommodation where an asylum applicant's claim for asylum support has been approved, they and their dependents are moved to dispersal accommodation whilst their asylum claim and any subsequent appeal are processed.
3.	Accommodation for failed asylum applicants and immigration detainees released on bail who may be eligible for support if there is a legitimate barrier to their removal.

Transport
Transport is provided for asylum applicants and their dependents during their asylum application process to ensure they arrive at required destinations for interview appointments. 
Service users needing accommodation are transported from the point of claim to the allocated site on the initial accommodation estate.
Once a claim for support has been agreed the service users are transported from initial accommodation to the assigned dispersal address.
Project Vision
Asylum Accommodation and Support Contract aims to deliver a VfM and affordable accommodation and support system which effectively delivers the UK's statutory and international obligations to asylum seekers, supporting the operation of effective immigration controls. 

The system will ensure the safety and security of service users and their host communities. Services will be delivered as consistently & efficiently as possible at a level which is proportionate in comparison with the services offered to UK nationals:  
•	Service users will experience an accessible and easy to navigate system, which delivers consistent and compassionate support. The system will protect the vulnerable, keep service users safe, orientate them to live in their communities and prepare them to act on the outcome of their asylum claim.
•	Providers will supply a service of which they are proud, securing a broad supply of accommodation and appropriate support services. The department will take practical steps to give them greater certainty on demand, with a sustainable balance of risk, an appropriate rate of return and scope for innovation in delivery.
•	Communities will feel involved in the support of destitute asylum seekers, working in partnership with UKVI.",,,"Any region","55250000 60112000 60120000 60130000 60140000 70330000 79900000 85144000 85300000 98334000 98341000 ","AASC Procurement Team",aascprocurement@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk,"The Secretary of State for the Home Office Department (UKVI)","2 Marsham Street",London,"SW1P 4DF",England,,http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office,,"http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:289909-2017:TEXT:EN:HTML&src=0 ","The contract end date is to be confirmed in due course.",01/09/2019,30/08/2024,07/11/2017,NO,,No,No,No,,600000000,0,,,,,,," ",

Family Mosaic as a group is looking to develop approximately 1,000 new homes per year, across all tenures to reflect Government changing priorities, whilst maintaining a programme of affordable rent by generating cross subsidy through developing shared ownership, private sale and market rent new homes. The proportion of each tenure will dependent on each site and location.
In addition to the above Family Mosaic as Lead Registered Provider will on occasions provide development services to other RPs as part of its funding agreements with the GLA and HCA, together with other separate legal entities formed for specific projects or programmes (these companies are either whole owned or partially owned by a member of the Family Mosaic Group).
Family Mosaic's new works construction programme over the four years duration of this framework is estimated to be in the region of 740 million GBP, with 30% of this delivered by S106s, leaving a balance of 518 million GBP pounds of directly instructed construction works. In addition to the Family Mosaic's programme this framework is being procured on behalf of other Registered Providers and Local Authorities who may wish to develop within London (the GLA area) and Essex, and who wish to sign up to Family Mosaic Framework. This will enable framework suppliers to access an additional volume of work and reduce their pre-qualification costs. At present there is no other RPs or LAs signed up, but to allow scope for this possibility the value of this framework construction costs are estimated not to exceed 600 million GBP.
Family Mosaic Housing wishes to establish a Framework Agreement for Contractor Services with contractors who can deliver on this varied programme together with supplying these services to other Registered Providers and Local Authorities who register to use this Framework for the purposes detailed above in the geographical area of Greater London and Essex.
The scope of this framework is principally to cover new mixed tenure residential developments above the EU procurement threshold, with a majority of the contracts in the range of 5 million GBP to 15 million GBP. For contracts below threshold Family Mosaic may opt to procure from SMEs and for exceptionally large contracts, regeneration projects choose to separately advertise these opportunities as part of an OJEU process. To ensure that Contractors who are appointed to the framework have sufficient financial capacity to carry out contracts on this framework a minimum annual turnover requirement has been set of 18 million GBP (see PQQ).",,,"East of England,London","45210000 45111000 45000000 45211200 45211000 45211100 45211300 45211341 45211340 45200000 ","Cora Marler",cora.marler@sweettgroup.com,"Albion House","20 Queen Elizabeth Street",London,"SE1 2RJ","

HO/15/01,Contract,"HOME OFFICE",Awarded,2018-12-11T13:00:32Z,"Provision of In-Country and Overseas Escorting, operation and management of Short Term Holding Facilities and Holding Rooms and related services","The Home Office is responsible, under the Immigration Act 1971 and the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, for detaining and/or enforcing the removal of certain persons (detainees) from the UK.
The Immigration enforcement directorate of the Home Office is responsible for the provision of escorting services and detention.
At any one time, approximately 3400 detainees are held overnight in one of the Immigration Removal Centres, residential Short Term Holding Facilities, prisons and police stations across the United Kingdom. In addition, persons can be detained for shorter periods of time in holding rooms at reporting centres, land and sea ports.
This often entails the provision of transportation for detainees and escorts who will travel with them to their final destination and hand them over to the appropriate authorities. This will include vulnerable detainees, (e.g. with a medical condition), as well as those who refuse to leave the UK voluntarily and those being removed on chartered flights.
The Home Office has sought a commercial partner for the provision of a number of distinct, but fully integrated services. These services include (but are not limited to):
- the escorting and transportation of detainees within the UK (In-Country escorting services),
- the escorting of detainees from the UK to and from an overseas destination (Overseas escorting),
- management of detainees detained at holding rooms and Short-term Holding Facilities (STHFs),
- operation and management of Short-term holding facilities.
The escorting and transportation of persons who are subject to the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 may also be required.
There may also be a requirement to escort service users for other government departments.

The PSDP will be responsible for the delivery of a wide range of development activity including masterplanning, site assembly, development in accordance with relevant SRF,planning applications, enabling infrastructure provision, procurement of construction contractors for the re-development, securing capital/funding and delivery of asset management/disposal which may involve marketing and positioning. Further details are provided in the procurement documentation.

Applicants should note the possibility that further elements may ultimately form part of this contract opportunity.Whilst it is not anticipated that the full range of options will be identified during the procurement process Mayfield Partnership Ltd recognises that:
— Network Rail owns (or will own by virtue of delivering the Northern Hub) a number of railway arches and small freehold sites either within or proximate to the Site's existing red line boundary. Whilst they are not part of the Site, some or all of these interests may, at some point in the future, be introduced into Mayfield Partnership Ltd's land holding and could involve Network Rail joining Mayfield Partnership Ltd;
— it is possible that other development opportunity sites may be added to the Site and/or delivered by the JVV or the successful joint venture partner during the life of the JVV, but it is not anticipated that these sites will be identified during the procurement process;
— it is also possible that the members of Mayfield Partnership Ltd might wish to develop and/or fund office elements of the project separately from the JVV, eg to meet the requirements of an anchor tenant(s). In this scenario, the intention is that the PSDP should act in a Development Manager role (in relation to these elements) for an agreed fee.

Integrated Debt Services Ltd will offer a range of existing & new services that provide improved debt management & increased net yield through better debt analytics, debt collection, debt enforcement, litigation and fraud & error services and possibly debt sales.
It is expected that the PSP, through Integrated Debt Services Ltd, will have/provide:
1. A proven ability to deliver reliable, high quality & innovative retail debt management services at scale in the UK; or an equivalent proven scale retail debt services delivery capability elsewhere, together with comprehensive & credible evidence of sufficient practical understanding of the UK debt market and experience of successfully adapting retail debt operations to demonstrate the ability to succeed in the UK;
2. A proven ability to manage a supply chain in the debt services arena;
3. A proven ability to adapt services to comply with relevant local legislative, regulatory requirements & good practice;
4. Experience of working successfully in joint ventures or partnerships with the public or private sector;
5. Initial funding; and
6. The ability to grow a sustainable and profitable business.
The debt management services to be provided by the DMI are a comprehensive and integrated suite of debt management services including, but not limited to:
— Analytics (for example but not limited to Predictive Modelling, Collection Optimisation, Purchase and use of Business/Market Intelligence, Decision Analytics, Case Management);
— Collection (for example but not limited to Debt Collection, Case Management, Payments Accounting, Debtor Correspondence, Data Management, Management of third party suppliers of these services);
— Enforcement and Litigation (Debt Collection, Case Management, Payments and Accounting, Debtor Correspondence, Data Management);
— Fraud & error services;
— Debt Sales; and
— Strategic & tactical advice on improving debt yields.
The Departments that are collaborating with the Cabinet Office as ‘Initial Customers' of the DMI are Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the Department for Works and Pensions (DWP), the Student Loans Company (SLC), ) and the Home Office (HO), however, the Cabinet Office envisages the DMI will offer cost effective debt management services to all its customers including other UK Contracting Authorities. As set out in the Contract Notice, the number of Initial Customers was subject to change. The Legal Aid Agency and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency did not become Initial Customers. It is intended instead that they will enter into call off contracts with the DMI company during the term of the Framework Agreement.",,,"Any region","72300000 72212000 73110000 73120000 73200000 73300000 75100000 79110000 79140000 79210000 79223000 79342000 79411000 79412000 79510000 79570000 79621000 79721000 79940000 72000000 ",,ralph.oliver@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk,"Cabinet Office, 4th Floor","1 Horse Guards Road",London,"SW1A 2HQ",England,,,"DMI Framework Agreement.zip DMI Standard Terms and Schedules.zip ",,"HMG will retain a significant minority equity stake in the DMI with corresponding Board representation including an influence in its future strategy and growth. HMG will retain responsibility for UK debt-related policy and legislation.
The DMI will be a non-public corporate entity with a Board and Management team appointed by its owners. Its growth and profitability will be directly linked to its ability to improve debt management and increase net yield for HMG and other customers.
The successful bidder for the role of PSP will acquire and hold equity share capital in the DMI through a Shareholders' Agreement, Articles of Association, Subscription Agreement and other relevant documents.
The Cabinet Office recognises that, in order to provide the services required and achieve the stated objectives, the PSP may use sub-contractors to provide some of the services. It is expected that the DMI will provide the sole route to market for debt management for the Initial Customers.     
The DMI services should be flexible, allowing customers of the DMI a choice to procure either a single service or any number of services across the whole range of offerings in order to satisfy individual circumstances, timetables and specific requirements. The Cabinet Office will award to the PSP a Framework Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Notice. Call Off Contracts will then be entered into between the DMI and the Initial Customers.

The Contracting Authority intends to procure the Contract for its own benefit & for others to whom it has an obligation to provide certain services. It is anticipated that the Contract will cover a wide range of services & some works elements incl without limitation the following: 
- Building Services
- Property & Asset Management
- Facilities Management
- Catering
- Cleaning
- Miscellaneous building related services
-          Capital works projects (especially in relation to schools)
-          Architectural design & related services
This list is not exhaustive & consideration may be given during the procurement process to the inclusion of additional services or options for additional services which will assist in delivering the Services. 
The Framework Agreement (FA)
In addition, the Contracting Authority is keen to make the benefits of the Services delivered under the Contract available to publicly funded schools & other public bodies in the area. 
The Contracting Authority is therefore seeking to procure a separate FA or the Services & services substantially similar to the Services.  The Contracting Authority will be acting as a central purchasing body through which the following organisations may choose, but shall not be obliged, to procure the Services using the FA: 
(1)    the other local authorities & publicly funded bodies that are identified in Annex A of the OJEU Contract Notice; & 
(2)    all publicly-funded schools & other educational establishments within the geographical areas of the Contracting Authority & the Participating Bodies. 
Accordingly it is the intention that all these organisations should be able to rely on this procurement to purchase such services without the need for any further procurement process.  For the avoidance of doubt, whereas the Contracting Authority currently provides some of the Services (for example, school catering services) to local schools as part of its own arrangements, it is intended that this will in future be carried via the FA, rather than the Contract. 
 
The duration of an individual call-off contract under the FA will not necessarily be limited to four years but will be governed by the precise subject matter of the call-off contract concerned. 
The form of the call-off contract will be agreed during the current procurement process & set out in the final FA, subject to the right to make specific amendments in respect of an individual call-off. 
No guarantee or warranty is given as to the nature or volume, if any, of the Services or the number of call-offs, if any, under the FA. 
It should also be noted that in addition to any change in the structure or identity of the Contracting Authority &/or the Participating Bodies in the event of re-structuring within local government, this procurement &/or the Contract & any FA awarded will pass to successor authoritie",,,"Yorkshire and The Humber","79993000 ",,zrobinson@wakefield.gov.uk,"Wakefield Council, Wakefield One, Burton Street",,Wakefield,"WF1 2EB",England,,,,,,31/10/2016,30/10/2023,15/04/2016,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,500000000,0,26/07/2016,500000000,"[Engie Services Limited|Shared Services Centre

We have a shared ambition to develop a high quality strategic employment site for the Nissan supply chain and other advanced manufacturing that will be an attractive location for national and international business investment and job creation.
A key part of accelerating economic growth is creating the conditions for private sector investment - supporting the ability of companies to trade on a national and international basis, ensuring the mobility and supply of local labour and a local supply chain and making suitable land and buildings available.
The IAMP aims to expand upon the existing North East automotive manufacturing hub and will continue the strong local track record as a location for high quality, adaptable manufacturing.

The contract is a key operational service in maintaining a stable environment and supports the HMPPS decency agenda, which focuses on [normalising] aspects of prison life to prepare eligible prisoners for release.

The current solution is provided as part of a nationally managed service providing wholesale goods, logistics/fleet and management of multiple workshops (17 in total), located within prisons utilising 520 prisoners to pick, pack and despatch an estimated 66,000 orders a week. 

This project is looking at the re-procurement of the service and looking to hear from interested parties capable of providing the wholesale goods and/or the management of multiple workshops",,"LS1 4AP","Any region","55510000 ",,kevin.mcgilvray@justice.gov.uk,"102 Petty France",,London,"SW1H 9AJ",England,,,,,"
The primary objective of the service is to meet the demands of the paying consumers, providing a range of goods at prices comparable to that of convenience store retailers and responsive to the changing population demographics and external influences (e.g. healthy eating campaigns). The service aims to deliver orders in a timely, efficient manner while ensuring that prison security policies (national or local) are never contravened.
Financially a key aim of the service is that it is self-financing and that the service overheads are covered through the cost of sales. The service must not exploit the customer (prisoner) population and instead should be seen as an opportunity both to play a key role in the operation of a prison environment and also providing opportunities for re-skilling and resettlement on release (e.g. job interviews, offers of work). 
The information contained in this notice is indicative of current thinking and subject to change. ATTENTION: the value of this opportunity provided reflects the spend which is managed through the contract (the cost, overheads and margin AND sales), this is due to the self-financing nature of the service. 
The Project will be holding an open market engagement event at the Ministry of Justice ,5 Wellington Place, Leeds LS1 4AP on Thursday 16th May 2019 starting at 10am (registration from 9:30am). 
This is a follow up to the previous supplier engagement event held January 2018 and will be an opportunity for us to:
1. provide high level information on the project and our requirements;
2. openly answer questions (creating a common understanding of the project);
3. create networking opportunities for suppliers;

The morning will feature a presentation with open Q&A and the afternoon will be reserved for a small number of 1-2-1 meetings with interested suppliers. Details for requesting a 1-2-1 session together with a data capture questionnaire will be published on Bravo. Suppliers are encouraged to monitor the PQQ folder .
The project will, throughout the engagement process up to the formal procurement commencing, publish materials via Bravo, FAQs and other information to maintain transparency in engaging with the market. Suppliers are encouraged to monitor the PQQ folder (note: the PQQ function is being used for secure communication and is NOT an invitation or commitment to tender).

As part of this framework, the Trust wishes to include a number of related non-exclusive incremental services, which may be called off at some point during the life of the framework and also to provide similar call-off contract opportunities to other authorities (listed in the tender documents) in respect of their Hard FM, Asset Management and incremental services needs as defined from time to time.

Instead of tendering for a service provider in the simplest form i.e. to deliver standard Hard and Soft FM Services, the Authorities have decided on a Strategic Asset Management approach to delivering this contract as a single supplier framework, where the intention is to enter into a call-off contract for a strategic partnership with a preferred framework partner for a long term arrangement, where all services under the banner of Hard FM, Soft FM and Asset Management might be included. It is intended that this framework would be open to local STP and other trusts or public sector bodies in England, however this is subject to the Authority agreeing access to the framework that is in line with its own strategic needs and purposes to facilitate and deliver services as required. In addition to this long term arrangement, there are multiple incremental options, which the Authorities will define during this procurement process, which may be utilised in the future across the Authorities or via other associated public sector organisations who might need the services and support of this framework, and as agreed with the Authorities from time to time.  Included in the strategic approach are a set of vested contract principles designed to facilitate and develop a true partnership approach, such as the ability for the preferred partner to 'earn' additional years of the contract relationship through over performance and exceeding expectations from the core contract minimum standards.  The two Authorities (CCST & CPFT) and their associated site information and data, will be utilised during the procurement process to enable the trust to call off from the framework on day one of the framework contract going live. There will be incremental options that the trust wishes to exercise and draw down from the preferred partner during the life of the agreement, however the bidders' solutions to the Trust's requirements will be developed through the dialogue process. The high level non-core and incremental options to form part of this framework are outlined in the tender documents.In respect of Partnering in a Joint Venture with the Authorities, there is an expectation that there might be risk sharing, investment, responsibility and reward in operating the services and potentially seeking new commercial opportunities to provide services to third party customers.The Authority, and any subsequent call off Authority, reserves the right to novate or assign any call-off contracts entered into to any subsidiary body established by the Authority to manage or co-ordinate their FM, Asset or development services requirements.Call-Off agreements under the framework may result in TUPE.The Authority will seek to recover the costs incurred in the establishment and management of this Framework. This obligation is met by means of a Retrospective Rebate which will be payable by the Service Providers to the Authority based on the total turnover of business conducted under the framework",22/07/2019,21/07/2023,13/12/2018,NO,,No,No,No,Services,500000000,0,,,,,,,"CompetitiveDialogueOJEU ",

(1) The contracting authorities are looking to procure and award contracts for the provision to each of their pathology services.

Each of the contracting authorities reserves the right not to award any contract(s).
(3) The precise place or places of work will be determined through the tender process but the selected supplier will need to provide at least some elements of the services from the premises of the Core Contracting Authorities.
