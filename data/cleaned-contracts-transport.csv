Through the introduction of more choice in the market, LB Croydon are ensuring that they follow best procurement practice by allowing healthy competition for each requirement. The DPS will allow LB Croydon to improve the sourcing process and deliver efficiencies both internally and for suppliers as well. Importantly, LB Croydon want to ensure that all suppliers are operating at a similar level of quality and so only those suppliers that meet LB Croydon's minimum quality criteria will be invited to tender for individual contracts through the DPS.

The purpose of Supported Transport is to plan, procure and manage transport services that are required to transport members of the public to essential amenities in the county, such as mainstream and special schools and social care establishments. The service also facilitates transport for some isolated communities through community transport initiatives and its own Comet Bus. We also manage the concessionary fares scheme, which allows for free travel for the elderly and some disability groups.
The service typically procures over 1500 unique routes over the course of a year, ranging from procuring just a single journey to a long-term arrangement over several years. Longer term requirements for mainstream special schools range from 4 to 6 years. The maximum contract length including extensions is 8 years.
The Council is introducing a DPS to create a more efficient process for tendering Supported Transport. This will involve introducing an electronic system known as DPS where Applicants will pre-qualify via a Standard Selection Questionnaire (SSQ). Successful Applicants will be invited to tender for services during a Call-Off mini competition. The Service Categories covered by the DPS are:
•	Mainstream home to school transport;
•	Special Education Needs & Disabilities (SEND) transport;
•	Social Care transport

Services will mainly be required within the Oxfordshire boundary and in some cases within bordering counties. Out of county services for the Service Categories defined above will also be tendered through the DPS.
For more detailed information and guidance on the DPS please see the DPS Introduction and Guidance Document published with this SSQ.

NEW Devon CCG is actively partnering with Devon County Council in a three year Total Transport Project, which will be examining synergies between the different strands of public-sector transport in Devon. Patient Transport in Devon is an integral part of that work and providers will be part of the multi-organisational Transport Forum chaired by Devon County Council.

We are seeking to tender the Non-Emergency Patient Transport Service (NEPTS) for all patients registered with a Devon GP. In constructing the tender we have taken steps to ensure that there is an attractive, clear and robust specification and workload for bidders to respond to.

• We have removed the bulk high volume car-journeys from the system by looking to let the Frequent-Attendees Car Service as a separate lot through Devon County Council’s Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS).

•We have focused the NEPTS contract on the core ‘traditional’ PTS workload looking to utilise multi-use vehicles to deliver an efficient and effective service.

•Out of area patients and the smaller volumes between midnight and 7am will be let outside of the main NEPTS contract, through DPS, allowing bidders to choose whether they wish to add these parts onto the main NEPTS contract or not.

•A booking service in partnership with the Local Authority will deal with initial contact from the public and manage the first line of authorisation and eligibility

We are actively seeking flexible and solution-orientated companies who are keen to make a positive mark in the NEPTS market. 

Our 3 key success factors to achieve from this procurement are:

1 - Provision of a quality, flexible and responsive service

2 - Excellent communication to establish strong relationships with key stakeholders 

3 - Sustainability. We want to work with a provider who will become our partner in delivery of an improved system

The Department of Health defines Non-emergency Patient Transport Service (NEPTS or PTS) activity as being the non-urgent, planned transportation of patients, with a medical need for transport, to and from premises providing NHS healthcare.  This encompasses a wide range of vehicle types and levels of care consistent with the patients’ medical needs. The overarching principle of PTS is that patients who are eligible for transport will receive safe, timely, comfortable and appropriate transport, without detriment to their medical condition.

In accordance with Regulation 34 (18), the Council is extending the time frame for the evaluation of initial Requests to Participate to up to 6 weeks to carry out robust due diligence checks on Suppliers' suitability to be admitted to the DPS and on their economic and financial standing, and technical and professional ability.   
Under Regulation 59 we will also require documentary evidence to be submitted with Requests to Participate and at any other time to ensure the proper conduct of the procedure. 
The DPS is part of the Council's suite of transport arrangements and will be used for procurement of transport for both long and short term contracts, alongside other procurement methods. Suppliers should therefore note that the DPS will not be an exclusive arrangement and the Council may award transport contracts to other suppliers on any alternative basis.
The DPS will be divided into ""Lots"". The Lots are based on the different types of vehicle that the Council requires. The people requiring the Services will be children and young people attending mainstream schools, special schools and pupil referral units and Social Care service users (children and adults) and, potentially, other individual Council service users. The majority of Services will be delivered within the Council's administrative area but from time to time Services will also be required to be provided outside the Council's administrative area. 
The Lots are: 
1. 4 to 8 Seat Vehicles 
2. 9 to 16 Seat Vehicles
3. Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles
4. Specialist Transport Services (e.g. Ambulance, Secure Transport)
5. Emergency Transport (call off within 1 hour - 24 hour requirement)
6. PSV Passenger Transport Services (e.g. Home to School)
The Council cannot forecast likely demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPS is no guarantee that the Supplier will actually receive instructions from the Council to deliver Services. Suppliers may apply for appointment to as many Lots as they wish.
The DPS will operate for a period of five years commencing on or around 1st September 2019. The Council will have the option, at its discretion, to extend the period of operation of the DPS for a further period or periods of up to two years and reserves the right under Regulation 34 (28) to give notice of any changes to the validity of the DPS.
Suppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPS are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (""SQ"").

It has an annual expenditure of over £900m on goods and services and a population of 1.3m. The Council provides a wide range of personal and strategic services on behalf of its residents, operating in partnership with 12 district councils and 289 parish/town councils. This requirement from the Growth, Environment and Transport Directorate is for the future provision of services operated using PSV or Community (Section 19 or 22) Bus Permits. The requirements relate to the Council's activity in respect of Supported Local Bus (including Kent Karrier) and Home to School Transport Services. Supported Bus services are procured for the delivery of socially necessary bus services (including Kent Karrier), where the authority will fund the provision of a local bus service which is not commercially viable, which would therefore not otherwise run but which the authority has identified as meeting a social need i.e. rural connectivity. Home to School Transport services are procured to provide school transport for those pupils who are determined by our Education and Young People's Directorate as eligible for free home to school transport. Where the volume of pupils is sufficient to justify a larger vehicle (minibus, coach or bus) these will require provision of this transport by a Public Service Vehicle Licensed Operator who can run services either as a public bus service or as a privately hired vehicle. In accordance with best procurement practice, EU & UK Procurement Directives & Regulations and Kent County Council's Standing Orders, the Council wishes to create a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) listing of approved suppliers of Supported Local Bus and Home to School Transport Services.

 The successful Provider is expected to manage all aspects of the NEPTS service including booking, eligibility and assessment and activity management, transportation, logistics and management information.
 Service users expect the NEPTS to integrate as far as possible with other relevant services improving their overall experience. The Provider will recognise a person's holistic needs as far as possible.
 The procurement for NEPTS in North East Essex brings together all those services North East Essex CCG is responsible for into a single contract. The rationale for this is that:
 — Patients can get confused who to contact with regards to their transport;
 — Commissioners have multiple contracts with multiple arrangements in place which sometimes lead to reduced accountability, performance and value for money; and
 — Providers lose opportunities for efficiency and ways to innovate.
 NEPTS will be commissioned on patient outcomes. This means that the proposed outcomes sets out to achieve ongoing improvements and measures of patient experience. NEPTS outcomes will be mapped back to the National Outcomes Framework, CCG outcome data set and PTS overarching objectives. This will develop over the lifetime of the service and evolve through a series of planned, interim commissioning states in order to develop the provider environment that is seamless and fits around the person.
 The main Domains within the NHS Outcome Framework that are likely to be measured against are:
 — Domain 2: Enhancing quality of life for people with long-term conditions;
 — Domain 3: Helping people to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury;
 — Domain 4: Ensuring that people have a positive experience of care; and
 — Domain 5: Treating and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting them from avoidable harm.
 The PTS high-level outcomes and aims of the service are:
 — Resilient, flexible and responsive;
 — Customer focussed, safe, comfortable and timely transport;
 — Innovation and use of information technology;
 — Value for money;
 — Good communication and performance information; and

The County of Somerset covers a large geographical area.  It has a dispersed, mainly rural population of approximately 540,000 people, with only one in four of its residents living in one of its three largest towns; Taunton; Yeovil; and Bridgwater.   

Somerset has two acute trusts within its borders (Taunton & Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust) as well as 13 community hospitals (run by Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust) and 75 GP practices. The Somerset population also relies on access to services in a number of neighbouring out of county trusts.  These journeys, referred to as Zone B journeys, are generally for services which are more specialist in nature.  

Full details of the specification, activity, scope and requirements can be found in the Contract documentation and the Specification is supported with detailed journey information, maps and background information.
Bidders must be aware of the range of settings of care and the challenges that this diversity presents in terms of the resourcing and planning processes as well as its impact on the load factor and the ratio of loaded to unloaded mileage.  Bidders should consider ways of achieving improvements against the current performance.

In constructing the tender the Commissioners have taken steps to ensure that there is an attractive, clear and robust specification and workload for bidders to respond to. 

•	The Specification excludes car journeys and PTS ambulance journeys which require the support of qualified crews
•	The Commissioners have focussed the NEPTS contract on the core ‘traditional’ PTS workload looking to utilise multi-use vehicles to deliver an efficient and effective service. 
•	Out of area journeys (Zone C) are included within the contract base but with a separate payment tariff.  
•	The Patient Transport Advice Centre and Authorised Booking staff in the Trusts will make the booking requests and manage the eligibility criteria.  

We are actively seeking flexible and solution-orientated companies who are keen to make a positive mark in the NEPTS market. 

Our 3 key success factors to achieve from this procurement are: 

•	The provision of a quality, flexible and responsive service which meets the contracted performance targets.
•	Excellent communication – IT and booking systems across the stakeholder community 
•	Sustainability – an operational model which strives for innovation and efficiency with experience of delivery

The duration of the agreement will be for 60 months, with an option to extend to up 24 months.

Negotiated procedure without prior publication
No tenders or no suitable tenders/requests to participate in response to restricted procedure
Extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable for the contracting authority and in accordance with the strict conditions stated in the directive.

Following the original tender exercise in 2015, only one tender was received. The contract was awarded to that tenderer. Due to unforeseen issues the contract will need to be terminated early and there will be no provision of Non-Emergency Patient Transport Services. Therefore there are no suitable bids, and the CCG and the other participating CCGs cannot be left without a provider and as a consequence this contract needs to be placed urgently. 
The contract duration is the same as awarded under the initial tender process.
Following publication of this notice in OJEU (sent to OJEU 1/11/16) , the contracting authority will allow a 10-day standstill period prior to entering into the contract, pursuant to regulation 99(3)(c) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015.",,,South East,60000000 34114000 34115000 85100000 ,Alan Beasley,alan.beasley@nhs.net,NHS High Weald Lewes Havens CCG,,Lewes,BN7 2PB,England,,,,,,12/11/2016,11/11/2019,02/11/2016,YES,NHS/SoEPS/13.185 Tender,No,No,No,Services,50100000.0,0.0,28/10/2016,50100000.0,"[South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust|Unit 7 & 8

The period of validity of the DPS will be 7 years from commencement.

A procurement process was initiated by Luton and Bedfordshire Clinical Commissioning Groups on 1 September 2017 (OJEU reference 2017/S 167-343841). A separate procurement process was initiated by Hertfordshire Clinical Commissioning Groups on 18 September 2017 (OJEU reference 2017/S 179-366553).
Both contracts resulting from the procurement were due to 'go live' on 1st April 2018.
Due to unforeseen circumstances, the incumbent provider Private Ambulance Service (PAS) has gone into administration, and is no longer trading, therefore there was a significant risk that there would be no provision of non-emergency patient transport services across Bedfordshire, Luton and Hertfordshire jeopardising the health and well-being of patients (to a potentially fatal degree). Therefore this contract had to be placed urgently.
The contract duration will be for an initial 2 years, starting on 13th October 2017, with the option to extend by a further year. Maximum contract duration will be 3 years.
Given the nature of business modelling involved and the associated resource implications for the potential provider it is necessary for the contingency contract to be for a minimum 24 months, in order for this to be a financially viable proposition. Otherwise the costs of a short-term contract would be prohibitive and would potentially negatively impact on the wider health care system.

Based on a 2-year + 1 year extension, the new indicative procurement timelines (high level) would be as follows:
* Indicative timeline based on a 2 year term (contract term 13th October 2017 to 12th October 2019):
- Pre-procurement activities (incl. market engagement) from August to October 2018
- Formal Procurement Process (2 stage, 'Restricted' procedure) from November 2018 to March 2019

The proposed Framework Agreement will be for two years with an option to extend for a period or periods totalling no more than a further two years.  We anticipate that 20 Providers shall be awarded a place on Framework Agreement. 
The Council procures journeys for children, young people and adult service users, as well as for Council staff using taxi providers.  These journeys are commonly planned e.g. trips to and from school or unplanned e.g. one-off journeys to an appointment. These taxi journeys supplement those provided by the Council's fleet of in-house buses. A given service user may be transported exclusively by taxi or bus or a combination of the two.
Service users using taxis require additional support or supervision which is provided through a passenger assistant, arranged by the taxi provider.  Some service users using taxis have additional needs of the vehicle e.g. the size of vehicle or ramps and wheelchair accessibility.  Some service users need the driver and/or passenger assistant to have specialist training e.g. how to help someone with a medical condition such as epilepsy.
The service is demand led and the volume of work may therefore increase or decrease over time. In 2018-19, approximately 200,000 journeys were commissioned.

The introduction of this new hydrogen refuelling facility and the supply of hydrogen for the buses in London is critical to this programme. Consequently, this procurement is a major new opportunity for a supplier to contribute towards the zero emission future for London and across Europe.
The Contracting Authority plans to award a single contract package to a supplier that will:
1. Generate all (100%) of the hydrogen off site and deliver it to the HRS (or compliant variant bid, see below);
2. Design and build the HRS that will dispense hydrogen daily to two buses concurrently at a rate of up to twelve buses per hour, with a duration of less than five minutes refuelling time per bus;
3. For resilience, store sufficient safety stocks of hydrogen at the site as specified or have capability to provide hydrogen from elsewhere in the case of fuel supply failure, power supply energy failure, equipment breakdown or maintenance;
4. Maintain all equipment and systems according to manufacturer's specification;
5. Train the bus operator's equipment users; and
6. Decommission the Hydrogen Refuelling Station at the end of 10 years supply (or after up to 15 years if the contract is extended).

225,GLA 80692,Contract,TRANSPORT FOR LONDON,Closed,2015-09-18T11:19:05Z,Rough Sleeper Services,"2.1	Overview

The funding and responsibility for pan-London rough sleeping services were devolved from central government to the Mayor in 2011.  The GLA has been funding and commissioning rough sleeping services, projects and initiatives that are pan-London or multi-borough in their remit for four years. These complement and supplement those provided or commissioned by boroughs, which have the primary responsibility, and receive the bulk of government funding, for providing or commissioning services. 

Between 2011 and 2016, the Mayor has committed almost £87 million to tackling rough sleeping – over £42 million for services, almost £40 million for improving hostels, and £5 million for a permanent home for No Second Night Out (NSNO). In addition, the GLA has administered the world’s first rough sleeping Social Impact Bond, investing up to £5 million between 2012 and 2015. 

2.2	Commissioning Framework
The GLA’s commissioning over the last four years has been underpinned by the Mayor’s 2011-15 Rough Sleeping Commissioning Framework (Volume 1) and it has resulted in the provision of some highly successful and often innovative services and initiatives. These have had, and continue to have, a major impact on rough sleeping in the capital and also a positive influence on the services delivered by other  partners.

The Mayor’s commitment to tackling rough sleeping remains as strong as ever and the Rough Sleeping Commissioning Framework (Appendix Five) outlines the achievements to date plus the commissioning priorities going forward and how each service will support the priorities outlined. 

GLA requires contracts to be put in place for 2016.

The Mayor also wants the energy market to work better for Londoners, delivering fairer prices, helping them reduce their energy use and make the best use of smart innovations. The GLA procurement is open to innovative ideas that will deliver its desired outcomes and wants to establish a genuine collaboration with a company or consortium to achieve them. 
The Contracting Authorities seek to procure a fully licensed energy supplier to offer the supply of gas and electricity to all of London's residents using branding set up by the GLA under the Mayor of London's Energy for Londoners programme; and to undertake Voids Services for London Boroughs (LBs) and Housing Associations (HAs).

The key eight objectives are:
1. Competitively priced electricity and gas tariffs
2. Customer service and branding: Exemplary customer satisfaction 
3. Innovation: Innovating to help Londoners and especially those in fuel poverty to better meet their energy needs and budget for them.
4. Integration with other energy programmes
5. Data access: Provide access to all EfLSCo customer consumption data, for the GLA, LBs, contractors and research partners.
6. Financial: Generate a commission, without affecting the competitive viability of tariff structures.
7. Support the possible future transition to a fully licensed supplier or to another Service Provider.
8. Void Services: Support handling vacant properties, including installation of smart meters during void periods.

The Contracting Authorities are setting up a four (4) year Framework Agreement. The EfLSCo scheme will be delivered via a Call-Off from the Framework Agreement based on a four-year term, with the option for an extension or extensions of up to four more years. The LBs and HAs detailed may enter into Call-Off Contracts under the Framework Agreement for Voids Services. 
The procurement will follow the Competitive Dialogue procedure (under PCR 2015) to allow for the agreement scope and commercial arrangements to be developed and negotiated during the process, using an outcome based specification.  During this process, comments will be invited on draft framework and call-off contracts at Initial Tender.  Upon issue with the Final Tender, Framework and call-off contracts final terms must be accepted.
Securing and management of the EfLSCo customers will be handled by the Service Provider, and all interactions will be performed by the Service Provider's staff. The estimated turnover that the Service Provider would be able to generate across the four-year term is of the order of £279 million, including Voids Services.  If the GLA choose to extend the call-off arrangement for a further four years an additional £713 million estimated turnover may be realised. All numbers are estimates and are not guaranteed by GLA and assumptions associated with customers acquired are set out in the procurement documents.",,,London,09000000 65000000 44161110 71314200 71314300 ,Nadeem Iftikhar,NadeemIftikhar@tfl.gov.uk,55 Broadway,,LONDON,SW1H 0BD,England,,https://tfl.gov.uk,,https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=f559b8b6-d152-e811-80eb-005056b64545&fromProjectDashboard=True ,"

276,TfL 93754,Contract,TRANSPORT FOR LONDON,Closed,2018-09-24T09:19:02Z,Build to Rent Joint Venture Investment Partner,"TfL is seeking to appoint an investment partner to co-invest in a new corporate joint venture vehicle. The vehicle shall have the right to purchase (on market terms) an Anticipated Seed Portfolio of up to 10 sites currently in TfL' s ownership in the expectation that, thereafter, it shall develop private rental units (Build to Rent (BtR) units) on those sites. TfL expects the equity proportions to be 49% TfL to 51% private investor.

The BtR Investment Partnership (the Partnership) will offer a rare opportunity to invest in BtR across London at a considerable scale.

The Partnership will have the ability to achieve significant scale through potential access to TfL's wider landholdings, which includes in excess of 400 sites across London and the potential to deliver tens of thousands of homes. The Anticipated Seed Portfolio has excellent diversification across London in terms of scale, location and accessibility, with the potential to deliver in excess of 3,000 units over the next five to ten years. The Anticipated Seed Portfolio currently includes development sites at Nine Elms, Southall, Woolwich, Canning Town, Arnos Grove, Cockfosters, Hounslow West, Montford Place, Newbury Park and Wembley Park. In addition to investing in direct delivery, it is envisaged that The Partnership may seek to acquire units in completed developments.

This exercise is to select an investor only and is not to procure works, supplies or services. TfL is looking for an investment partner with experience of investing in build to rent developments in order to maximise the capital value of its surplus sites. It will therefore will be testing for the appropriate investment experience that will leave the resulting JV well placed to appoint an appropriate and cost effective supply chain once the business is underway in order to maximise return at investment level, not at supply chain level.

The Concessionaire will be required to:
• Administer the FORS scheme in a lean, efficient way and to an exceptional standard, in the interest of road safety and the environment • Improve the scheme's economic sustainability through the diversification of revenue streams so it is not solely reliant on operators
• Ensure the scheme offers value for money to fleet operators and organisations which mandate FORS in their contracts
• Work collaboratively with industry and multiple audit providers
The Concessionaire will be responsible for the administration aspects of the FORS scheme which include but are not limited to; project management, processing finances, marketing/PR/communications, provision of a helpline, website, commercialisation of assets, certification, audit provision management, quality assurance and compliance. Established by TfL in 2008, FORS is a TfL owned accreditation scheme which requires freight and fleet operators to meet specific safety and environmental standards that are above and beyond the legal minimum. Embedded in procurement contracts, FORS allows operators to compete on quality not just on costs, and encourages progressive operational, management, driver and vehicle improvements. Since the appointment of the current Concessionaire which followed a competitive procurement exercise in2014, FORS has grown significantly and today has over 5,000 accredited operators, consisting of over 105,000vehicles. There are now accredited operators across 17 countries and FORS is seen as international best practice. Further information can be found at www.fors-online.org.uk
To prevent a conflict of interest, the Concessionaire cannot be:
• A FORS audit provider - as they will be required to undertake independent Quality Assurance on the audits and issue/enforce certifications
• The FORS Governance and Standards provider - who sets the FORS Standard and acts as a final independent appeals board on audits, audit provider management, compliance and certification",,,Any region,63520000 63521000 ,Philip Lewis,philiplewis@TfL.gov.uk,197 Blackfriars Road,London,London,SE1 8NJ,England,+44 2030541461,https://tfl.gov.uk,,http://doodle.com/poll/pcyyr9fswhprbrcm ,"

291,2754,Contract,SOUTH YORKSHIRE PASSENGER TRANSPORT EXECUTIVE,Awarded,2018-06-06T10:27:38Z,Rotherham Interchange Refurbishment,"Over the past 10 years regular structural inspections of the car park have revealed a number of defects in columns, beams and slabs and a number of smaller repair schemes have taken place to maintain the car park's structural integrity.  In 2012 the main access bridge was replaced, its main structural pier strengthened, and whilst the car park was closed, a number of repairs on ramps critical to internal circulation were undertaken to enable future car park
Deterioration of the remainder of the car park has continued and a number of options for repair and re-development of the site have been considered.  Planning permission was granted for the refurbishment/repair of the car park on 30 May 2014. Subsequently a number of alternative development schemes have been considered and a preferred option of refurbishing both the car park and interchange below has been chosen to be taken forward.
During the intervening period, a bus fire on stand A6 in May 2016 which caused extensive heat and smoke damage to the structure and fabric of the building and with the exception of immediate repairs to get the bus station operational, fire damage repair works have been included within the refurbishment scope.

In addition, the works will include the replacement of vehicle restraint barriers; replacement of the external cladding and edging panels; replacement of fire damaged floor planks; installation of roof-top canopies; refurbishment of the surface water drainage system; upgrading the internal lighting; replacement of emergency lighting, fire detection and alarm systems; replacement of lightning protection system; improvements to the internal finishes; new signage; installation of photovoltaic panels at roof level; refurbishment of stair towers; reconfiguration of the bay markings and redecoration.

The Bus Station works will comprise the refurbishment of terrazzo plinths; replacement floor finishes; cleaning of wall and replacement of ceiling cladding; replacement of internal seating; refreshment of pedestrian entrances; in information hubs and customer service desk; demolition of platform C toilets; repair of platform C canopy; New head of queues, signage and information screens; cleaning fire damage; drainage; electrical works; replacement of air handling units; replacement of lighting; replacement of emergency lighting, and fire detection systems; new PA, audio impairment and Wifi systems; renewal of CCTV installations; upgrading existing building management system; replacement of fixed ANPR and people counters; repairs to existing bus runways",,,Yorkshire and The Humber,45262300 45262330 45453100 ,,tendering@sypte.co.uk,11 Broad Street West,,Sheffield,S1 2BQ,England,,,,,"Please go to www.sypte.co.uk/contracts to obtain a Specification, Supplier Selection Questionnaire and Instructions on how to submit an expression of interest in this tender.",01/03/2018,31/01/2019,15/12/2017,YES,2754,No,No,No,Works,11500000.0,0.0,20/04/2018,11552006.0,"[Interserve Construction|Ingenuity House

South Yorkshire Supertram Limited (SYSL) (a subsidiary of Stagecoach), operate the Supertram network, and maintain the majority of the asset for the Executive, under a Concession terminated in 2024.

The wear of the embedded rails had reached a condition on certain lengths of the network where it required replacement to prevent the flange of the tram wheels running on the bottom of the rail groove.  Accordingly between 2013 and 2015, approximately 15km of embedded rail was replaced.  It is proposed to complete the remaining 10km of replacement over the summers of 2018, 2019 and 2020.

The works comprise the replacement of the remaining sections of embedded rail on certain sections of the Sheffield Supertram Network where wear has reached a critical condition.  The Executive and South Yorkshire Supertram Limited need to ensure the system remains operable and in order to achieve this, the embedded rails need to be replaced.

Lot 1 - Hire of Vehicle Telematics and Associated Products & Services  - The Customer shall pay a monthly hire price per vehicle which covers the supply, installation and maintenance of a data recording device and associated equipment, monthly service charge and all other products and services required by the Customer stated in the Contract.
Lot 2 - Outright Purchase of Vehicle Telematics and Associated Products & Services - The Customer may choose to either:
a) outright purchase the data recording device and associated equipment and other required products and pay a monthly fee per vehicle for the service required during the contract term; or
b) pay a lump sum to purchase the data recording device and associated equipment, and other products and services required, as well as pay upfront for the service required during the contract term.
It is envisaged that most of the customers accessing the framework will have a requirement for a vehicle telematics system suitable for cars and light commercial vehicles.  However, some customers may wish to use the framework to procure a telematics solution for their specialist vehicles, e.g. winter gritting vehicles, snow ploughs and refuse collection vehicles.

The framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months.  The total estimated value stated includes the option period.
An eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.
As a Central Purchasing Body as defined by the EU Procurement Directive 2014/24/EU, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined https://www.espo.org/ESPO/media/Documents/FAQs/ESPO-s_powers_to_trade__website_-2016-12-22.pdf) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament.

336,AASC,Pipeline,HOME OFFICE,Closed,2017-07-27T16:18:05Z,Asylum Accommodation and Support Services Contract,"Under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, UKVI has an obligation to provide accommodation & support to asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute.
The service user support services will include the provision of:

Accommodation
Accommodation is provided to support asylum applicants and their dependents who would otherwise be destitute. Accommodation is to be provided by the service provider(s) covering a number of regions in the UK. Accommodation provision is through local authorities, private and other accommodation providers e.g. housing associations. Accommodation is paid for on the basis of usage only, with the provider taking the void risk.
Three types of accommodation services required are:
1.	Initial accommodation where a destitute asylum applicant and their dependents will reside before a decision is made on their support claim. 
2.	Dispersal accommodation where an asylum applicant's claim for asylum support has been approved, they and their dependents are moved to dispersal accommodation whilst their asylum claim and any subsequent appeal are processed.
3.	Accommodation for failed asylum applicants and immigration detainees released on bail who may be eligible for support if there is a legitimate barrier to their removal.

Transport
Transport is provided for asylum applicants and their dependents during their asylum application process to ensure they arrive at required destinations for interview appointments. 
Service users needing accommodation are transported from the point of claim to the allocated site on the initial accommodation estate.
Once a claim for support has been agreed the service users are transported from initial accommodation to the assigned dispersal address.
Project Vision
Asylum Accommodation and Support Contract aims to deliver a VfM and affordable accommodation and support system which effectively delivers the UK's statutory and international obligations to asylum seekers, supporting the operation of effective immigration controls. 

The system will ensure the safety and security of service users and their host communities. Services will be delivered as consistently & efficiently as possible at a level which is proportionate in comparison with the services offered to UK nationals:  
•	Service users will experience an accessible and easy to navigate system, which delivers consistent and compassionate support. The system will protect the vulnerable, keep service users safe, orientate them to live in their communities and prepare them to act on the outcome of their asylum claim.
•	Providers will supply a service of which they are proud, securing a broad supply of accommodation and appropriate support services. The department will take practical steps to give them greater certainty on demand, with a sustainable balance of risk, an appropriate rate of return and scope for innovation in delivery.
•	Communities will feel involved in the support of destitute asylum seekers, working in partnership with UKVI.",,,Any region,55250000 60112000 60120000 60130000 60140000 70330000 79900000 85144000 85300000 98334000 98341000 ,AASC Procurement Team,aascprocurement@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk,The Secretary of State for the Home Office Department (UKVI),2 Marsham Street,London,SW1P 4DF,England,,http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office,,http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:289909-2017:TEXT:EN:HTML&src=0 ,The contract end date is to be confirmed in due course.,01/09/2019,30/08/2024,07/11/2017,NO,,No,No,No,,600000000.0,0.0,,,,,,, ,

The Immigration enforcement directorate of the Home Office is responsible for the provision of escorting services and detention.
At any one time, approximately 3400 detainees are held overnight in one of the Immigration Removal Centres, residential Short Term Holding Facilities, prisons and police stations across the United Kingdom.

The above mentioned public sector bodies have a need for PEPPOL Access Point Services for the electronic exchange of business documentation including invoices and purchase orders. 

""PEPPOL (Pan-European Public Procurement Online)"" was initiated in 2008 with the aim of simplifying electronic procurement across borders by developing technology standards that could be implemented across all governments within Europe. The overall objective was to enable businesses to communicate electronically with any government institution in the procurement process, increasing efficiencies and reducing costs. 
This procurement will give access to PEPPOL Standards-based IT Transport Infrastructure through Access Points, and the services provided for eProcurement with standardised electronic document formats.
Department of Health has publicly committed to the adoption of PEPPOL across all NHS Trusts. The implementation of PEPPOL is intended to remove unnecessary process inefficiencies which arise during the transfer of business documents. It is estimated that the current process requires significant manual intervention. It is also means that a single supplier wishing to trade with the NHS may have to accept 150 different formats of purchase orders. 
The adoption of a single standard allows customers to exchange these business documents through a single 'Access Point'. The process reduces complexity and costs for the Contracting Body and for the Provider using what is commonly known as a 4 corner model. This allows the Contracting Body and the Provider to select their own Access Point Provide with PEPPOL mandating that information passes between the two. 

A key feature of the PEPPOL network is the freedom for suppliers to engage with an Access Point provider of their choice, to send and receive electronic documents with any organisation in the PEPPOL network through one single source, eliminating complex relationships with buyers, their service providers and related obligations. 
The network is governed by the PEPPOL Transport Infrastructure Agreements, establishing a many-to-many legal framework instead of the traditional bilateral agreements entered into between service providers.

The documents are routed through Access Points and the receiver's capabilities can be discovered by using the PEPPOL Service Metadata Publisher (SMP) services. The content and validation rules ensure consistency for all parties.

360,2017-01095 - Award,Contract,West Midlands Combined Authority,Awarded,2018-03-22T11:57:31Z,West Midlands Bikeshare Scheme,"-WMCA is procuring the operator based on a single-stage tender process with the aim of entering into a Concession Agreement for the operation of a Bikeshare scheme across the West Midlands pursuant to Regulation 19 of the CCR 2016. WMCA will evaluate tenders received on the basis of the evaluation criteria specified in the procurement documentation and will award a Concession Agreement to the bidder which submits the most economically advantageous tender. Estimated value: £15,000,000 and £30,000,000. (WMCA will be providing support for the scheme to help ensure its success, but will contribute neither to up-front (capital) or ongoing (revenue) costs). 

-WMCA is seeking a single supplier to provide a high quality Bikeshare scheme, with physical docking infrastructure with hybrid solutions, across the urban areas within each of the seven constituent authorities (Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton) from spring 2018 and the key features of the scheme are as follows:
i. A phased roll-out of the scheme is intended, potentially starting in central Birmingham, growing to become present in all constituent local authority areas within the first year.
ii. A Concession Agreement between WMCA and its official Bikeshare supplier will have an initial term of five years from the date of roll-out of the Bikeshare cycles, with a possible 3-year extension exercisable at the WMCA's discretion.
iii. The scheme will provide a minimum of 3,000 bikes.
iv. Bikes will be physically 'docked' in certain locations in city centres; and outside the city centre areas, it may be possible to provide geo-fenced docking stations subject to the agreement of the local highway authority but WMCA's preference is for physical docking infrastructure due to WMCA's planning and streetscape requirements.
v. The scheme will integrate fully with the existing public transport network to offer a seamless, high quality transport service for people in the West Midlands.
The Bikeshare scheme will be fully supported by WMCA, but it is to be fully owned and operated by the supplier. Bidders will be evaluated wholly on quality, as set out in the procurement documents. WMCA will be providing support for the scheme to help ensure its success, but will contribute neither to up-front (capital) or ongoing (revenue) costs. 
Due to the requirement that the scheme of operated across seven constituent authority areas, WMCA is not dividing the contract into lots, as the integration and cohesion of the scheme across these areas is fundamental to the success of the scheme.

This rate of growth places high pressure on the housing and transport infrastructure of the region, leading to congestion and other negative impacts which act as a constraint on investment and continued economic development. 

In order to address these pressures and maintain economic growth, significant and ambitious investments are being made in the region's housing, transport systems and other infrastructure.

•	Cambridgeshire County Council will use this framework to supplement existing arrangements where appropriate

•	Peterborough City Council will use this framework to supplement existing arrangements where appropriate

The fleet includes (but is not limited to) cars, vans, heavy goods vehicles, motorbikes, bicycles (approximately 2 000 assets in addition to the 5 300 assets mentioned above), plant (and equipment), and all in asset equipment' allocated to a vehicle/asset. The current Fleet Services team is made up of a combination of in house and outsourced capabilities providing a mix of services to MPS in order to keep the fleet in full operation at all times. Services are provided to and between a number of sites and locations within the Greater London Area and to a non-exhaustive list of locations outside the Greater London Area. The overall strategy for Fleet Services is to support MPS in achieving MOPAC's Police and Crime Plan and to provide a flexible and scalable solution that meets the future operational demands for fleet. The primary objective of Fleet Services is to provide MPS with the right fleet assets at the right time, in the right place, and in the most cost effective way. In order to achieve the above strategy, MOPAC, as the contracting authority, is tendering for the supply of a new Fleet Services solution to the MPS. Upon completion of the tendering process, MOPAC hopes to award a contract to a suitably capable contractor to provide Fleet Services for an initial term of 96 months. MOPAC will have a unilateral option to extend the contract for further periods up to a maximum of 48 months. To ensure that MPS receives the benefit of the contractors expertise, it is envisaged that the contract will give the successful contractor the freedom to provide the Services in the manner that it sees fit as long as the contractor complies with the service requirements and specifications outlined in the contract. The MPS will retain the right to source assets itself where it considers that the MPS will be able to obtain better value for money than the successful contractor. The exact requirements for numbers and specifications of vehicles will vary over time in accordance with operational demands. The contract will include flexible change mechanisms to enable the MPS to update specifications and volume requirements as needed in order to enable operational policing.

A more detailed specification of the contract scope will be provided with the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire and Tender documentation. The Council has considered key commercial elements of the new contract and the description below is only intended to provide a broad indication of the contract requirements.
 — Provision of the Council's statutory service consisting of a website and virtual catalogue, 15 static libraries, and targeted provision for individuals who are unable to access a static library within 30 minutes by public transport meeting minimum requirements as to service offering;
 — Provision of specified support to community-run hubs offering library services;
 — Offering by the Service Provider of enhancements to existing provision or support to community hubs meeting priorities set by the Council;
 — Provision of mobile library services to communities meeting specified criteria.

The Council may also wish to explore with the successful Service Provider the inclusion of Library IT Services (Systems, Support & Maintenance and provision of End-User Computing) and soft total facilities management of the Library Buildings.

In addition the Council may subsequently seek to invite the successful Service Provider to extend the scope of the contract during the contract term to include the management and operation of the whole or any part of its Heritage and Archive Services subject to lawfulness, relevant due diligence and best value considerations. For the avoidance of doubt, the Council has not made any decision that would permit Heritage and Archive Services to be included in the contract. Before this could happen consultation would be required with relevant stakeholders and a Council decision would be required. Any future addition of any Archive and Heritage Services would be voluntary on both sides i.e. the Council would have no obligation to call for those services and the Service Provider would have no obligation to provide them.

380,1346871964,Contract,Trafford Council,Closed,2015-08-04T08:36:28Z,Working Well Expansion Programme,"The expansion of Working Well is a central pillar of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority's (GMCA) devolution agreement with Central Government.    The ambition of the devolution agreement is to achieve better outcomes for residents by securing significant influence, and ultimately control, over public spending in Greater Manchester (GM). The agreement was made on the condition that the GMCA will adopt a mayoral model of governance. The benefits of the agreement cover a range of thematic areas including investment funds; transport; business support; housing; and planning.    The specific elements of the devolution agreement that are relevant to this tender exercise are:- a) An expanded Working Well programme, ultimately supporting 50,000 people to progress towards employment. Building on the existing programme, Working Well will provide participants with integrated, intensive support.  b) A co-commissioned Work Programme. GM will commission, jointly with DWP, Work Programme provision that draws on and complements Working Well expansion, a reformed post 19 skills landscape and broader employment and skills reform.  c) A reshaped FE post 19 skills system. GM will incentivise skills providers to focus on meeting the needs of defined GM priority groups, ensuring the right support is in place to move people on to employment or to continue in education.  d) A reformed approach to delivering the AGE Grant. Ensuring the use of the grant is aligned with broader support for GM residents and the priority growth sectors across GM.  e) Alignment of Skills Capital. Ensuring GM has the infrastructure that supports the delivery of a reformed employment and skills landscape.   In addition to supporting residents into employment, Working Well Expansion will support those in low paid or insecure employment to progress to higher skilled and higher paid jobs. Greater Manchester has low levels of productivity compared with London, and a key outcome of Working Well is to increase productivity levels and reduce dependency of those in work who continue to rely on benefits such as Working Tax Credits.    The Working Well Expansion will consist of three separate elements: personalised support (which this tender pertains to); the Mental Health Therapeutic Interventions tender; and the Skills for Employment tender. It is envisaged that these elements will begin delivery at the same time and they will work together and integrate with other local services, to provide a holistic approach to moving people into sustainable employment. The personalised support is the linchpin of the Working Well Expansion programme and all clients will be supported through this service.

Introduction

Bournemouth University first introduced a shuttle bus service in the late 1990’s with the primary objective of transporting students from university halls of residence to the university for the purpose of academic study. 
In 2009, Bournemouth University working with the Arts University College at Bournemouth, tendered for a 7 year university bus contract. The contract was awarded to Wilts and Dorset (more bus).
Since the commencement of the contract in 2009, there has been a growth in the number of passengers using the service each year. In 2014/15 the service recorded 800,000 passenger trips (see Appendix A), a 97% increase from 2009/2010. The number of routes has been expanded to 4, and the capacity and frequency of service has been significantly enhanced. For example the U1 route now currently operates a 10 minute frequency during term times and a 30 minute frequency during vacation periods. Although the main purpose of the university bus service is to ensure that Students are able to get to the university during the core operational hours (during term times, Monday to Friday) for the purposes of their academic studies, a number of service enhancements has led to a greater number of staff using the service to travel to/from work. In December 2014 a skeleton U3 vacation service was introduced to assist staff from Southbourne, Boscombe and Charminster to travel to the Talbot Campus all year round at peak times by bus. Staff have also been encouraged to use the U1 and U4 services for inter campus travel, and over 40% of staff use this service (Appendix B). 
The university bus service is a key Travel Plan measure for both BU and AUB. The university has invested significantly to enhance the bus service over recent years. Appendix C shows that annual investment in the service has doubled over the period 2010/11 to 2015/16. In addition the Universities have worked in partnership with both Poole and Bournemouth Councils to provide targeted improvements in infrastructure along the routes, including new bus shelters and real time information displays. As a result of this investment the University have seen a significant rise in both passenger numbers (Appendix A) and the revenue generated by the service (see Appendix C). 
The university is committed to a sustainable future. BU was ranked 'first class’ in the University League 2015 for its environmental and ethical performance. BU was placed seventh out of 151 universities in the table, compiled by People & Planet, and achieved a ‘first class’ ratin...",,BH1 3LH,South West,34121000 34121300 34121400 34121100 ,Barry Chapman,bchapman@bournemouth.ac.uk,Bournemouth House,Christchurch Road,Bournemouth,BH1 3LH,UK,01202 962774,www.bournemouth.ac.uk,,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/bournemouthuniversity/aspx/ ,"apply via Intend (our tendering portal); register for free

Provision of the operation of the Library Services both under the Council's statutory duty under section 7 of the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 and it's non-statutory provision.

The Council considered key commercial elements of the contract and the description below provides a broad indication of the contract requirements. 

•Provision of the Council's statutory service consisting of a website and virtual catalogue, 15 static libraries, and targeted provision for individuals who are unable to access a static library within 30 minutes by public transport meeting minimum requirements as to service offering;
•Provision of specified support to community-run hubs offering library services
•Offering by the Service Provider of enhancements to existing provision or support to community hubs meeting priorities set by the Council;
•Provision of mobile library services to communities meeting specified criteria

The Council may also wish to explore with the successful Service Provider the inclusion of Library IT Services (Systems, Support & Maintenance and provision of End-User Computing) and soft total facilities management of the Library Buildings

In addition the Council may subsequently seek to invite the successful Service Provider to extend the scope of the contract during the contract term to include the management and operation of the whole or any part of its Heritage and Archive Services subject to lawfulness, relevant due diligence and best value considerations. For the avoidance of doubt, the Council has not made any decision that would permit Heritage and Archive Services to be included in the contract. Before this could happen consultation would be required with relevant stakeholders and a Council decision would be required. Any future addition of any Archive and Heritage Services would be voluntary on both sides i.e. the Council would have no obligation to call for those services and the Service Provider would have no obligation to provide them.",,,East Midlands,79995000 92512000 48161000 92511000 92510000 92500000 ,Fiona Fielding,fiona.fielding@lincolnshire.gov.uk,Orchard House,Orchard Street,Lincoln,LN1 1BA,UK,+441522553649,,,https://www.delta-esourcing.com/delta/respondToList.html?noticeId=176124406 ,,04/04/2016,03/04/2021,16/02/2016,NO,,No,Yes,No,Services,40000000.0,0.0,16/02/2016,40000000.0,"[Greenwich Leisure Limited|Middlegate House

397,OLDH001-DN166705-41254221,Contract,Oldham Council,Closed,2016-06-10T10:47:42Z,National Framework for the Implementation and Operations of a Supplier Early Payment Scheme,"Oldham Council operates an Early Payment Scheme (EPS), whereby discounts are taken from invoices in
exchange for early payment. The discount is calculated dynamically, and is proportionate to how many days the payment is accelerated (number of days between invoice receipt and invoice payment sent). The discount is only taken if payment
acceleration is achieved. The purpose of such a programme is not only to generate new income for the Council but also to help suppliers by injecting much needed liquidity into the council's supply chain and in particular the local economy. The
Programme has also help to streamline existing Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) processes and maximise efficiency
within the council, while supporting the council’s compliance with payments legislation and its adoption of best
practice.
Consequently, Oldham Council is seeking to award a single supplier Framework Agreement, open to all local
authorities in the UK, for early payment programme provision, offered on a modular basis applicable either
Lot 1 Councils without an existing programme, wishing both to implement and operate such a programme
(“Implementation and Operation”)
Lot 2 Councils like Oldham with an existing programme, wishing to continue to operate such a programme
(“Continued Operation”).
The provider must have the capability to serve Councils in both situations and it is envisaged that in either
instance the provider will, if they or the council require it, precede the engagement with an assessment.
It is critical that the programme is implemented and operated in a holistic manner, with the provider able to bring
together each of the separate activities into a single seamless programme provision.
The council is seeking a provider with sufficient experience and expertise with comparable clients to mitigate
potential risks in the implementation and operation of the programme and ensure reliable delivery of the
required programme outcomes.

Oldham Council intends to make this Framework Agreement available for use by all UK Contracting Local
Authorities. 
The framework will also be available to:

398,LSC2203,Contract,Parliament UK,Closed,2016-06-24T13:31:35Z,LSC2203-Refurbishment of Elizabeth Tower,"The Corporate Officer of the House of Lords and The Corporate Officer of The House of Commons are undertaking key internal conservation and refurbishment works to the Elizabeth Tower, including waterproofing and addressing condensation problems as well as modernising the building to improve standards in safety, access and visitor and workspace facilities.

Completed in 1856, the Elizabeth Tower was constructed using 2600 cubic metres of brick and 850 cubic metres of stone, all of which were transported to Westminster by river. Designed by architects Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin, it took over 13 years to build. Renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012, to honour the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, it is regularly featured in popular culture and is one of the most photographed landmarks in the world.   

Background & Works to Date
To ensure that the UK’s most famous clock continues to keep time, specialist teams carry out regular maintenance and adjustments to the Great Clock. However, it has now been over 31 years since the last extensive works were carried out to maintain the Elizabeth Tower. 

Problems have been identified with the clock hands, mechanism and pendulum, which need to be dealt with immediately to ensure that the clock can continue to work properly. Identified areas of concern include cracks in masonry, leaks, erosion, and rusting of metalwork. There is a risk that if not addressed shortly the clock may fail or fabric problems may become acute. 

In addition, the Tower needs to be brought in line with fire prevention guidance and health and safety measures for staff and visitors need to be improved. In order to provide a better means of emergency evacuation, a lift will also be installed inside the tower, which will also provide access for maintenance.

The last significant conservation work was completed in 1983-85. This involved the cleaning and repair of the stone, painting and gilding works and repairs to the cast iron roof. The structure was stabilised in 1995/96 as a result of works carried out to the Jubilee Line. Parts of the clock mechanism were serviced in 2007, but other areas haven’t been overhauled in over 25 years. 

Project Objectives

•	Work to prevent the clock mechanism from failing 
•	Addressing problems caused by decay to the fabric of the building.
•	Health & safety and fire safety improvements, including installation of a lift.
•	Enhanced energy efficiency through modern lighting of the tower face and other measures.
Overall the project’s aim is to conserve the Tower for future generations.

The scope of this project includes: 

•	Facilitating Works to the Clock (Servicing of the Clock Mechanism to be carried out by Parliamentary Estates Clock Mechanics). 
•	Scaffolding/Access.		
•	Redecoration of the Cast Iron Roofs.		
•	Refurbishment of the Ayrton Light.		
•	Refurbishment of the Clock Faces and Hands.	
•	Stonework Repair.

Since 2006 that requirement has largely been met by the World Wide Food Services Contract. It is now inteneded to split the requirement into four separate contracts covering: the supply of food within the UK; dog food; in-flight catering and the supply of food to overseas locations. The overseas element will be met by this contract, the Overseas Deployable Food Programme (ODFP).]

      The term of the contract is 5 years with the possiblity of 2 x 1 year options available at the discretion of the Authority, with an approximate maximum value of £150,000,000 . It is estimated that the cost of food will account for approximately 30% of this, with non-food costs (logistics capabilities to source, store and transport the food) accounting for approximately 70% of the value of the contract . 
      The potential provider shall manage the supply chain to source and deliver fresh, ambient, chilled and frozen food products from core ranges of approximately 1000 lines (which may vary depending on location and scope).  A representative example of the tyrpical types and range of products is as follows:

      Ambient - canned Ham, tuna chunks in brine, mushy peas, canned red kidney beans, canned fruit cocktail, sultanas, cereals, apple juice tetrapack, biscuits, tea bags
      Chilled - cheese, eggs, margarine, butter, milk, meat products (beef striploin, beef mince, lamb leg, pork leg)

 The in-service support packages available are: RFA WAVE KNIGHT, RFA WAVE RULER, RFA FORT AUSTIN, RFA FORT ROSALIE, RFA FORT VICTORIA (Lot 1) - Estimated value £320M over ten (10) year contract duration; RFA LYME BAY, RFA MOUNTS BAY, RFA CARDIGAN BAY, RFA ARGUS, HMS SCOTT (Lot 2) - Estimated value £275M over ten (10) year contract duration; and / or RFA TIDESPRING, RFA TIDERACE , RFA TIDESURGE, RFA TIDEFORCE (Lot 3) - Estimated value £345M over ten (10) year contract duration, which will include but not be limited to: worldwide engineering support; rectification of Operational Defects; and the planning, management and implementation of maintenance periods. Maintenance periods may include, but not be limited to: Refit Periods; Docking Periods; Contractor Support Periods; Annual Certification Periods; and Assisted Maintenance Periods.
- The successful bidder will also be required to provide design, planning, implementation and technical services for the various update, upgrade and / or modification packages along with the global supply and transport of spares.

A joint team (the Authority and the successful bidder) will be co-located at the successful bidder's premises and work collaboratively with other CSS support. It is envisioned that there will be one (1) joint support team per Lot.

The contract will be for ten (10) years, with a value for money exercise commencing at the three and a half (3.5) year point. The Authority will have the option, at its sole discretion, to break the contract at the five (5) year point if it believes value for money is not being achieved.
Years one (1) to five (5) will be firm price i.e. not subject to variation, and years six (6) to ten (10) will be fixed price, subject to the price index / indices stated in the contract. The justification for the proposed framework duration is that RFA and OSV vessels require a refit period every five (5) years, and a ten (10) year framework will allow for two (2) refit periods within one contractual agreement which will provide benefits to both the successful bidder and Authority through learning for experience. Planning a refit period requires eighteen (18) months, and a seven (7) year contract period would risk interruption to the planning or delivery of a second refit period. Certification is required at a docking every five (5) years so a ten (10) year framework would afford full certification twice preventing the risk of uncertified and therefore unusable vessels in the fleet. This is therefore deemed as exceptional circumstances.

433,LSC2203,Contract,HOUSE OF LORDS,Awarded,2017-10-12T11:36:48Z,Refurbishment of Elizabeth Tower,"The Corporate Officer of the House of Lords and The Corporate Officer of The House of Commons are undertaking key internal conservation and refurbishment works to the Elizabeth Tower, including waterproofing and addressing condensation problems as well as modernising the building to improve standards in safety, access and visitor and workspace facilities.

Completed in 1856, the Elizabeth Tower was constructed using 2600 cubic metres of brick and 850 cubic metres of stone, all of which were transported to Westminster by river. Designed by architects Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin, it took over 13 years to build. Renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012, to honour the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, it is regularly featured in popular culture and is one of the most photographed landmarks in the world.   

Background & Works to Date
To ensure that the UK's most famous clock continues to keep time, specialist teams carry out regular maintenance and adjustments to the Great Clock. However, it has now been over 31 years since the last extensive works were carried out to maintain the Elizabeth Tower. 

Problems have been identified with the clock hands, mechanism and pendulum, which need to be dealt with immediately to ensure that the clock can continue to work properly. Identified areas of concern include cracks in masonry, leaks, erosion, and rusting of metalwork. There is a risk that if not addressed shortly the clock may fail or fabric problems may become acute. 

In addition, the Tower needs to be brought in line with fire prevention guidance and health and safety measures for staff and visitors need to be improved. In order to provide a better means of emergency evacuation, a lift will also be installed inside the tower, which will also provide access for maintenance.

The last significant conservation work was completed in 1983-85. This involved the cleaning and repair of the stone, painting and gilding works and repairs to the cast iron roof. The structure was stabilised in 1995/96 as a result of works carried out to the Jubilee Line. Parts of the clock mechanism were serviced in 2007, but other areas haven't been overhauled in over 25 years. 

Project Objectives

•	Work to prevent the clock mechanism from failing 
•	Addressing problems caused by decay to the fabric of the building.
•	Health & safety and fire safety improvements, including installation of a lift.
•	Enhanced energy efficiency through modern lighting of the tower face and other measures.
Overall the project's aim is to conserve the Tower for future generations.

The scope of this project includes: 

•	Facilitating Works to the Clock (Servicing of the Clock Mechanism to be carried out by Parliamentary Estates Clock Mechanics). 
•	Scaffolding/Access.		
•	Redecoration of the Cast Iron Roofs.		
•	Refurbishment of the Ayrton Light.		
•	Refurbishment of the Clock Faces and Hands.	
•	Stonework Repair.	
•	Structural Repairs and Waterproofing.

450,TRAF001-DN62837-00304455,Contract,Trafford Council,Awarded,2018-06-01T14:35:41Z,Working Well Expansion Programme,"The expansion of Working Well is a central pillar of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority's (GMCA) devolution agreement with Central Government.  
  
The ambition of the devolution agreement is to achieve better outcomes for residents by securing significant influence, and ultimately control, over public spending in Greater Manchester (GM). The agreement was made on the condition that the GMCA will adopt a mayoral model of governance. The benefits of the agreement cover a range of thematic areas including investment funds; transport; business support; housing; and planning.  
  
The specific elements of the devolution agreement that are relevant to this tender exercise are:- 
a)    An expanded Working Well programme, ultimately supporting 50,000 people to progress towards employment. Building on the existing programme, Working Well will provide participants with integrated, intensive support.   
b)    A co-commissioned Work Programme. GM will commission, jointly with DWP, Work Programme provision that draws on and complements Working Well expansion, a reformed post 19 skills landscape and broader employment and skills reform.  
c)    A reshaped FE post 19 skills system. GM will incentivise skills providers to focus on meeting the needs of defined GM priority groups, ensuring the right support is in place to move people on to employment or to continue in education.  
d)    A reformed approach to delivering the AGE Grant. Ensuring the use of the grant is aligned with broader support for GM residents and the priority growth sectors across GM.  
e)    Alignment of Skills Capital. Ensuring GM has the infrastructure that supports the delivery of a reformed employment and skills landscape. 
  
In addition to supporting residents into employment, Working Well Expansion will support those in low paid or insecure employment to progress to higher skilled and higher paid jobs. Greater Manchester has low levels of productivity compared with London, and a key outcome of Working Well is to increase productivity levels and reduce dependency of those in work who continue to rely on benefits such as Working Tax Credits.   
  
The Working Well Expansion will consist of three separate elements: personalised support (which this tender pertains to); the Mental Health Therapeutic Interventions tender; and the Skills for Employment tender. It is envisaged that these elements will begin delivery at the same time and they will work together and integrate with other local services, to provide a holistic approach to moving people into sustainable employment. The personalised support is the linchpin of the Working Well Expansion programme and all clients will be supported through this service. 
  
Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council is acting as the procurer on behalf of the GMCA to appoint a provider/s. The programme will be delivered across all ten Local Authority areas of GM:

The contract will be split into 2 lots, Lot N: North East, North West, Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside and Wales, Lot S: East of England, London, South East and South West.
PECS4 contractors will continue to physically transport  prisoners between locations but increasingly the requirement will be to enable and support changes to the core operating model for courts, prisons and the police
resulting from the implementation of MoJ reform programmes, including an increased proportion of business being delivered in a virtual environment with greater emphasis on the use of video technology. PECS contractors will be responsible for the movement of adult males and females from prisons and police stations to courts as well as, inter-prison transfers, the movement of children and young people from Young Offender Institutions (YOIs), Secure Training Centres (STCs) and Secure Children's Homes (SCHs) as well as care and security whilst in the court custody area and in the dock, and transfers from courts to prisons and other nominated locations at the conclusion of court business.
The services will include:
- Escorting of adults and children and young people,
- At Court Care and Security,
- Inter Prison Transfers,
- Bedwatches for Children and Young People,
- Prisoner Welfare,
- Tornado and Mutual Aid,
- Incident Management,
- Audit and Quality Assurance.
Each service component (adult and children and young people) will be separately specified, funded and managed.
The anticipated quantity or scope is an estimate of the potential value of the contracts and does not in any way
guarantee any level of expenditure. The estimated cost range is real in 2018, does not account for inflation and
includes any possible future changes to the requirement for services as listed in additional information of this PIN. All values should be considered as indicative only.
The award criteria will be based on the most economically advantageous tender. Potential providers will be able to bid for both lots but will only be allowed to win 1 of the lots, unless there is only one bidder across both lots, in which case both lots could be awarded to 1 bidder. Potential providers will be required to state within their response to the Selection Questionnaire (SQ) the lots they want to bid for. If potential providers bid for both lots, they must be prepared to be awarded a contract for either lot, and must not state a preference.

467,LSL/GS/0018,Contract,"LEIDOS SUPPLY, LIMITED",Closed,2019-02-07T15:57:52Z,The Supply of Batteries & Associated Items,"Team Leidos has a requirement for the supply of a range of Batteries and associated Items and intends to invite tenders for its MOD Batteries supply with a view to awarding Contracts that are targeted to commence in Summer 2019. Team Leidos will invite tenders against 36 Batteries/Chargers and associated Items.
Our customer, the MoD, requires us to provide Batteries, which include a proportion identified solely by brand names; product names and/or product numbers. This is because the use for which the product was codified required testing; manufacturer's approval; Design Authority approval; Submarine Toxicity Clearance; or the specific technical, chemical or physical properties of the specified item. The batteries and associated items have been codified in such a way that the brand name and/or part reference often form part of the coded characteristics which define the essence of the item. Given the way in which these particular products have been codified, and in accordance with PCR 2015 (Section 5, Technical Specification, 42. (5) and (12)) Leidos expects the brands/product names/product numbers specified for the MOD Batteries to be the only Batteries able to meet the MOD's supply requirements on some or all occasions, and considers therefore that the specification in this tender process of these makes and models of Batteries and associated items are justified by the subject matter of the Contract.	
For example, in instances where the parent equipment supplier has stipulated a particular product type or footprint, these are the items that must be provided and alternatives and near equivalents are unacceptable (We refer to these as Stated Product Types).  Similarly, in some instances, where the parent equipment supplier has specified a bespoke product these are the items that must be provided, alternatives are unacceptable (We refer to these as Specified Products).

Nonetheless, Leidos considers that there may be products that could on occasion meet the MOD's technical specification, but which are not yet certified and codified.  If a supplier identifies an alternative or equivalent Product in terms of Fit, Form, Function, which also meets the specified requirements, Leidos will consider appointing the supplier of such an alternative to the framework agreement, but it would require some items  to achieve Interim Certification prior to Full Certification before achieving any orders of that alternative. Note that all costs for achieving compliance will sit with the supplier, and the prices quoted must be reflective of certified products. These products must meet all other mandatory requirements and legislation compliance (e.g. product labelling and Dangerous Good Transport classification). Supplementary requirements (package quantities and additional labelling etc.) may also be involved in future Contract conditions.

Following opening of the A13 to the south in 1999, New Road was de-trunked, with work including some narrowing of the A1306, removal of subways, upgraded lighting, some tree planting and introduction of bus lanes.
Now, as the industrial areas surrounding the A1306 are redeveloped to provide housing, LB Havering has developed an ambitious scheme to further reduce the impact of the road, by converting most of the remainder of the corridor to single carriageway and by developing a linear park including (but not limited to) carriageway works, landscaping, pedestrian and cycle routes, sustainable drainage including swales, new lighting, public art, utility works, modifications to traffic signal junctions and to other junctions. Please refer to the full Scope within the tender documents, for further information.
The contracting authority is seeking to engage a suitably qualified and experienced contractor to develop the contracting authority's current design to a fully detailed design, and then to implement the scheme. The scheme is funded through Transport for London's Major Schemes / Liveable Neighbourhoods programme and the successful contractor will be expected to demonstrate relevant experience in working with the public sector to deliver a successful scheme. We would expect the successful contractor to carry out community and stakeholder engagement and obtain relevant consents.

480,PRO.TEC.0003,Contract,BIRMINGHAM ORGANISING COMMITTEE FOR THE 2022 COMMONWEALTH GAMES LTD,Closed,2019-09-09T14:27:00Z,Host Broadcasting Services,"71 Commonwealth nations and territories are expected to participate in the XXII Commonwealth Games, which is one of the world's largest multi-sport events, bringing together over 4 000 of the world's elite athletes every 4 years, in an 11-day festival of sport and culture. Events will take place from 27.7.2022 to 7.8.2022 in venues across Birmingham and the West Midlands. London's Olympic velodrome will also be utilised.

The principal role of the host broadcasting services supplier is producing and distributing high quality TV and radio coverage of the games to rights holding broadcasters (RHBs) and on to a global audience. The supplier will develop detailed production plans and requirements for each sport, and deliver the international TV and radio feeds and multi-channel service (a combination of a selection of live and delayed content) to RHBs. Amongst other content, coverage will also include medal ceremonies and presentations, daily highlights and news feeds.

Further information on the authority's requirements can be found in its descriptive document available at www.delta-esourcing.com

In order to maximise value for money, the Birmingham 2022 Organising Committee is undertaking this procurement collaboratively with CGF Partnerships Ltd with a view to awarding an agreement that will include options to extend the agreement to cover provision of host broadcasting services to the 2026 and 2030 editions of the Commonwealth Games. The host cities for the 2026 and 2030 editions are not as yet identified.

The current intention is to let the services opportunity on the basis of a host broadcasting master services agreement (the 'MSA') to be entered into between CGF Partnerships Ltd and the successful Tenderer, and a Organising Committee Services Agreement ('OCSA') between the Organising Committee and the successful tenderer. The first OCSA will be with the Birmingham Organising Committee for the 2022 Commonwealth Games Ltd ('Birmingham 2022') for the purposes of providing host broadcasting services for the Birmingham 2022 Games.

However, in the event that the Birmingham 2022 Organising Committee and CGFP determine that there is insufficient economic benefit in letting an agreement with options to extend for the 2026 and 2030 games, the authority reserves the right to award a services contract directly between Birmingham 2022 and the successful tenderer for the 2022 games only.

It is estimated that the MSA value range will be 60 000 000 to 90 000 000 GBP, dependent on whether the extension options are exercised. It is estimated that the OCSA contract value range for the Birmingham 2022 Games will be 20 000 000 GBP to 30 000 000 GBP. These costs include HB accommodation, catering, transport and those relating to ancillary equipment including broadcast power, overlay at venues (compound cabins and camera platforms) and contract variations.",,,West Midlands,92221000 ,Pamela Kelsall,pamela.kelsall@birmingham2022.com,"One Brindley Place,Brindley Place",,BIRMINGHAM,B12JB,England,07951 735849,www.birmingham2022.com,,https://ted.europa.eu/TED/notice/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:422453-2019:TEXT:EN:HTML https://www.delta-esourcing.com/tenders/UK-UK-Birmingham:-Television-production-services./6UT4PZ2HDQ ,,06/04/2020,30/09/2022,07/10/2019,NO,,No,No,No,Services,20000000.0,0.0,,,,,,,CompetitiveDialogueOJEU ,

As part of this commitment the Authority is seeking to fulfil the UK's obligations to provide assistance to adult victims of human trafficking, detailed in Articles 11 and 12 of the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings (ECAT), and is procuring a new contract to provide care for adult victims of modern slavery in England and Wales. Through this contract, accommodation, support and assistance will be provided to potential victims of modern slavery and human trafficking to assist in their recovery. The Authority will provide subsistence and support to all those where there are reasonable grounds to believe they might be a victim of human trafficking or modern slavery. The Authority seeks a commercial partner to provide the following support and assistance: • Support Services - providing accommodation or outreach support depending on the needs of victims • 24 Hour referral services - for First Responders to refer potential victims requiring immediate support ahead of making a full referral into the National Referral Mechanism • Transport - of victims and their dependants • Translation and Interpretation - to ensure that victims have the information they need in a language they understand • Subsistence - a means of providing financial support to victims • Reach In support services - for confirmed victims after leaving the main support service to aid the transition back in to society. The contract will consist of a 6 month mobilisation period, to allow suppliers to secure accommodation, staffing and set up the service to ensure a smooth transition from the existing contract,
having minimal impact on the Service Users - followed by a 5 year contract, with the option to extend by up to 3 years. We anticipate that the services as detailed within the tender documents and supporting annexes will be no greater than £160m over the initial five year term (including mobilisation). The low and high contract values given include scope for: a) the option to extend the contract from 5 to 8 years; b) volumetric variations and c) legislative or policy changes. The scope of the contract is in line with current legislation, policy and projected volumes of Service Users.
