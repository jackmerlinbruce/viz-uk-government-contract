Please refer to this for full details of the framework Band and Lot structure and all CPV codes.

Highways England continues to roll out the Asset Delivery model to its operational areas. There is a requirement to deliver a range of renewal, improvement and selected small scheme construction works on the Strategic Road Network in areas utilising specialist contractors working collaboratively with Highways England to deliver these works. It is envisaged that this framework will straddle two Road Investment Strategy (RIS) periods (RIS 2 and RIS 3) enabling a smooth transition between them. Works for schemes have been divided into a number of workstreams that align with the contractors' specialisms, and will also include design. Bandings have been introduced into the framework model to differentiate some contracting terms between bands.

-	Band A
General Civil Engineering

-	Band B
Temporary Traffic Management
Road Restraint Systems
Drainage

-	Band C

-	Band D

Participants should note that the full Scope will continue to be reviewed and refined beyond the issue of this notice.

Highways England will be hosting market engagement activities (format to be confirmed) to support the design of the procurement strategy for Scheme Delivery Framework (SDF). Expressions of interest in joining engagement activities are invited from all levels of the supply chain from Tier 1 suppliers to SME's and an email notification will be issued with further details. Interested suppliers are requested to email, providing full names and contact details to Procurement_SDF@highwaysengland.co.uk no later than 30th April 2020.

The maximum initial duration of any Call-Off Contract that may be placed by an eligible Contracting Authorities is 24 months with two extensions allowed, each of up to 12 months.
G-Cloud services, available via the Digital Marketplace, will require frequent procurement refreshes to bring on new suppliers and services. New iterations of this Framework are being considered at a frequency of 12 months depending on demand and/or availability of new services as the IT Cloud market develops.

Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, Crown Commercial Service (CCS) believes that the first condition set out in Regulation 72(1)(c) Public Contracts Regulations 2015 has been fulfilled in respect of the Framework Agreement.

Crown Commercial Service has taken the decision to extend existing framework agreements that were due for re procurement for a period of up to three months (3 months) for G-Cloud 12. This is to enable CCS resources to be diverted to procuring urgent requirements to deal with COVID-19 consequences and to relieve pressure on the supply chain while short staffed, to enable businesses to continue to deliver services and goods to customers. CCS intends to deliver replacement framework agreements as quickly as possible after the initial COVID-19 impact.",,,"Any region","48000000 ",,supplier@crowncommercial.gov.uk,"9th Floor, The Capital Building","39 Old Hall Street",Liverpool,"L3 9PP",England,"0345 410 2222",https://www.gov.uk/ccs,"G-Cloud-12-Rate Card Template-RM1557.12 Version 1.pdf G-Cloud 12 MI template-RM1557.12 Version 1.xls G-Cloud 12 Application FAQ .docx G-Cloud 12 Key changes between the G-Cloud 11 and G-Cloud 12 Call Off Contracts-RM1557.12-V2.docx G-Cloud 12 Key changes between the G-Cloud 11 and G-Cloud 12 Framework Agreement-RM1557.12-V2.docx Attachment 1 & 2 G-Cloud-12-ITT-RM1557.12-v8.docx G-Cloud-12 Call-Off Contract-RM1557.12-v11.docx G-Cloud 12 Framework Agreement-RM1557.12-v8 (1) (1).docx ",,"The contract notice can be found on Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) and our website:

The Council is seeking to establish an open select list (framework) of approved providers who can deliver the following services referred to as community supported living services

Lot 1
A) Care and Support Only
B) Care and support in existing and established dedicated accommodation settings
C) Care and support with a new accommodation requirement

Lot 2
D) Care and support in exceptional circumstances.

This replaces the current community supported living - open select list (CSL-OSL) which is the contractual arrangement currently in operation for the commissioning of Community Supported Living services as detailed for vulnerable adults who may have a range of different needs including learning disabilities, physical disabilities, mental health and co-occurring conditions. 

The purpose of the service is to enable vulnerable adults to develop existing skills or acquire new skills to increase their independence in daily living through appropriate risk taking, identify and enable opportunities for education and employment, and ultimately meet their desired outcomes as detailed within their Personal Plan. In addition services focus on keeping individuals healthy and safe.

To enable continuity of care and ability to meet needs which may fluctuate over time, it is a pre-requisite that providers have CQC Registration for personal care.

The open select list will run for an initial duration of 5 years, with options to extend for a period or periods up to a further 2 years.

The DfE offsite framework is being established to cultivate innovation and modernise the industry by increasing the adoption of MMC (modern methods of construction) offsite production in the market, in line with the government's commitment to MMC and its presumption in favour of offsite construction by 2019 across suitable capital programmes, where it represents best value for money.
The DfE has appointed 5 contractors to each Lot. 
Lot 1 is intended for the delivery of offsite built Secondary Schools and Secondary blocks of Gross Internal Area (GIA) 6,000 m2 and above throughout England, but the DfE may use Lot 1 to deliver batches of primary school schemes. Schemes awarded under the framework will be subject to a mini competition or allocated via a performance based allocation procedure. The stated Lot value of 2 000 000 000 GBP is the maximum headroom for schemes delivered under this lot but the actual value of schemes is anticipated to be lower than this figure. The median anticipated pipeline for Lot 1 is expected to be a throughput of 15 secondary schemes per year. DFE makes no guarantee to any Bidder or contractor that they will be awarded any schemes and no guarantee is made in respect of any volume of work under the Framework Agreement.
Lot 2 is intended for the delivery of offsite built primary school schemes and secondary blocks of GIA from 750 to 6,000+ m2 throughout England, but the DfE may use Lot 2 to deliver secondary school schemes above 6,000 m2. Schemes awarded under the framework will be subject to a mini competition or allocated via a performance based allocation procedure. The stated Lot value of 1 000 000 000 GBP is the maximum headroom for schemes delivered under this lot but the actual value of schemes is anticipated to be lower than this figure. The median anticipated pipeline for Lot 2 is expected to be a throughput of 15 primary schemes per year,. DFE makes no guarantee to any Bidder or contractor that they will be awarded any Scheme Contract and no guarantee is made in respect of any volume of work under any Scheme Contract, or in aggregate under the Framework Agreement.

The Department for Education (DfE) is seeking multiple providers to design and deliver Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) courses supporting recruitment to Initial Teacher Training (ITT). A framework agreement will replace the grant funding model currently in place for the SKE programme, and will be the only means of drawing down funding from the DfE for SKE courses delivered from October 2020.

SKE is a key part of the Department's teacher supply strategy and supports recruitment to ITT in hard-to-recruit subjects. It is for applicants who have a conditional offer of a place on an ITT programme. SKE programmes are designed to help these applicants gain the depth of subject knowledge needed to train to teach in their chosen subject.

SKE courses:
- support conditional offers to places on ITT courses or High Potential Initial Teacher Training (HPITT) programmes;
- must only be offered to Participants who, without SKE, would be highly unlikely to meet the subject knowledge requirements of the Teachers' Standards by the time their ITT course is complete;
- enable Participants to train to teach their chosen subject;
- need to include a mechanism for informing the ITT provider of progress made by the Participant on completion of the course;
- must end before the Participant completes their ITT course and before a recommendation for the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) is made; and,
- cannot be longer than the minimum duration recommended by the ITT provider to address the subject knowledge gaps of a Participant.

For more information on the service requirement, the procurement process and to access the tender documents please go to: https://education.app.jaggaer.com/

Please note: The estimated value is the maximum budget for funding SKE courses over the term of the framework agreement and includes both provider payments and participant bursary payments. Acceptance onto the framework will not guarantee any funding and individual call-offs will be made on the instruction of the participant undertaking the SKE course.

Please note: There is no restriction on the number of providers that can be appointed to the framework and the Department intends to run subsequent procurements on an annual basis to appoint further providers to deliver SKE training courses.",,,"Any region","80000000 ",,SKE.inbox@education.gov.uk,"Sanctuary Buildings, 20, Great Smith Street",,London,"SW1P 3BT",England,,,,"https://education.app.jaggaer.com ","

Hyde wants to become synonymous with creating beautifully designed homes where people want to live, which are socially and economically successful and with quality placed at the heart of what we do. Our customers rightly demand high standards of quality and finish -whatever price they may pay for their home. This can range from a subsidised rent of 150 GBP per week rent through to 1 000 000 GBP purchase price for an apartment. The scope of works required will differ under each call-off contract, but the programme primarily covers new build residential works, with the possibility of some ancillary retail and commercial development.

A framework agreement will replace the grant funding model currently in place for the SKE programme, and will be the only means of drawing down funding from the DfE for SKE courses delivered from October 2020.

SKE is a key part of the Department's teacher supply strategy and supports recruitment to ITT in hard-to-recruit subjects. It is for applicants who have an offer of a place on an ITT programme. SKE programmes are designed to help these applicants gain the depth of subject knowledge needed to train to teach their chosen subject.

Further details will be published with the tender pack.
 
Please note: The value is the maximum budget for funding SKE courses over the term of the framework agreement and includes both course costs and participant bursary payments.

Services being procured are Chest surgery (trans masculine), Genital surgery (trans feminine) and Genital surgery (trans masculine).

The Services will be available to individuals eligible for NHS-funded care who are ordinarily resident in England, Scotland or Wales - or otherwise who are the commissioning responsibility of the NHS in England, Scotland or Wales - and who meet the eligibility criteria described in the Service Specification. Successful Bidders will hold a single contract with NHS England for services provided to eligible patients who are the commissioning responsibility of NHS England, NHS Scotland and NHS Wales.

The NHS pathway of care for adults with gender dysphoria will differ according to the individual's goals. The envisaged adult pathway may typically be summarised as: 

•	Referral to a specialist Gender Dysphoria Clinic 
•	Assessment for gender dysphoria, and diagnosis
•	Individuals who meet the criteria for diagnosis of gender dysphoria are accepted on to the NHS care pathway and an individual treatment plan is agreed between the individual and their lead clinician in the Gender Dysphoria Clinic
•	Certain therapeutic interventions are delivered by the Gender Dysphoria Clinic; and / or referral for interventions with other providers; which may include recommendations to primary care for prescribing endocrine treatments
•	Gender Dysphoria Clinic makes a referral for surgical interventions of the chest and genitals if criteria are met via a planned National Referral Support Service
•	Ongoing review and monitoring during and after interventions
•	Conclusion of contact: discharge to primary care

Contracts will be for an initial term of 5 years with a possible extension of any period up to a further 2 years as defined and at the discretion of the Commissioner.

These services will be available to children and young people aged 0-18 (up to 19 for children and adults with Special educational needs and disability - SEND) in Cambridgeshire, neighbouring authorities and where directed by specific care plans, nationally. The successful Providers will be responsible for providing this service and liaising closely with the Contract Manager identified by the Authority.
The tender is led by Cambridgeshire County Council, however Cambridgeshire County Council and Peterborough City Council (PCC) have made strategic decision to combine roles and departments to manage services across both local authorities. Peterborough will have access to the DPS in their own right.
The DPS is open for an initial term of five (5) years commencing on 1st April 2019 and ending on 31st March 2024 with the options to extend for an initial period of two (2) years, then after further review, for another two-year-period to a final one (1) year extension (5+2+2+1), up to a maximum of ten (10) years from the date of the original contract date.
The anticipated spend across PCC and CCC for the duration of the DPS is £470,184,791.00. The spend is across the two local authorities for all four lots as listed above, however it is the local authorities' intention to reduce this spend through application of the new DPS, improving outcomes for individual children and the use of the mini competitions within the DPS over  its lifetime.
The DPS is open for new applications, rounds will close periodically through out the life of the DPS, please refer to the tender for the closing date of the next round.",,,"East of England","85000000 ","David Isaacs",david.isaacs@cambridgeshire.gov.uk,"Shire Hall","Castle Hill",Cambridge,"CB3 0AP",England,"+44 1223703518",https://www.lgss.co.uk/about/,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=65cf6068-f00c-e911-80f0-005056b64545 ",,30/03/2024,31/03/2024,29/03/2024,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,470184791,470184791,,,,,,,"Open ",

In order to meet the capacity requirements, the Council intends to procure 106 additional units through block contract arrangements that the Authority expects will be available within 18 months of contract award. This opportunity would suit providers who are interested in/planning on carrying out an extension or renovation to a home(s) to increase capacity in East Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire and South Cambridgeshire or carry out a new build in these areas.The Authority will assess Potential Providers' mobilisation plans to ensure that they are robust and deliver units within this timeframe.
In addition, the Authority is aiming to procure 243 block contracted units in Cambridgeshire that will be available immediately after the award of contract. This would suit providers that currently have spot-purchased contracts with the Authority (where a Council funded service user is placed outside of a block contract), but wish to take up the opportunity of a block contract. It would also suit providers who the Authority do not currently commission from but have the ability to offer capacity.
The contracts are for an initial period of 5 years with options to extend for up to a further 10 years, making 15 years in total.

The role of the SDP is expected to include development management, devising a funding strategy and overseeing delivery of the Scheme. It is also anticipated that the SDP will have the opportunity to act as developer on elements of the Scheme to be agreed through the procurement process.
It is anticipated that the Scheme will be brought forward on a phased basis due to the size of site and scale of development opportunity available. The Council wishes to appoint a SDP who can not only partner with the Council on a long term basis but also be flexible in their approach to each phase of development. This will include tailoring the SDP's role and level of commercial return to reflect the specific circumstances of each development phase.
The Council's key requirement for the redevelopment of the Site (""the Project"") include:
•	repurposing surplus retail and other redundant space within the Site boundary for uses which help to support the economic development of the Town Centre which includes increasing footfall, encouraging an evening economy and helps to catalyse further development within the town;
•	the Site should be developed for a mixture of uses that could include, but are not limited to residential, hotel, food and beverage, a new leisure offer, (such as cinema or bowling), market /independent retail, education, health and/or flexible workspaces;
•	as part of the new development scheme the Council would like to provide new facilities for the indoor market within the Site, which will help to improve both the quality and mix of market stalls and to increase the market's prominence on the High street where the intention is to relocate it  inside the former Marketgate building;
•	to improve the pedestrian permeability of the Site and to connect with other areas of the Town Centre;
•	to deliver a Scheme of a high architectural and urban design quality, which responds positively to the surrounding conservation areas and creates a new place within the Town Centre;

      The United Kingdom Ministry of Defence is considering an exciting opportunity to revise the approach to contracting expertise in support of Digital & ICT Roles. The intention is to select a number of suppliers onto a Flexible Delivery Partner Framework (FDPF) covering all D&IT capability and expertise required to deliver MOD Digital IT Programs and transformation for the next three to five years.
      
      The new framework will be a multi-lot framework that has a number of suppliers per lot to deliver a wide range of capability and expertise to MoD. The MoD will define the lot and initial capability required but will not constrain what capability suppliers can put forward as long as it fits with the capability family under the specific lot. It is anticipated that suppliers may be successful across multiple lots resulting in an estimated six to nine strategic delivery partners.
      
      The estimated value of throughput on this framework is up to £300M per year, with an initial 3-year contract duration (with possible options for extension) under consideration. The option periods are also estimated up to a value of £300M per year, with a potential future value over the life of the contract of £1.5bn.

As part of this commitment the Authority is seeking to fulfil the UK's obligations to provide assistance to adult victims of human trafficking, detailed in Articles 11 and 12 of the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings (ECAT), and is procuring a new contract to provide care for adult victims of modern slavery in England and Wales. Through this contract, accommodation, support and assistance will be provided to potential victims of modern slavery and human trafficking to assist in their recovery. The Authority will provide subsistence and support to all those where there are reasonable grounds to believe they might be a victim of human trafficking or modern slavery. The Authority seeks a commercial partner to provide the following support and assistance: • Support Services - providing accommodation or outreach support depending on the needs of victims • 24 Hour referral services - for First Responders to refer potential victims requiring immediate support ahead of making a full referral into the National Referral Mechanism • Transport - of victims and their dependants • Translation and Interpretation - to ensure that victims have the information they need in a language they understand • Subsistence - a means of providing financial support to victims • Reach In support services - for confirmed victims after leaving the main support service to aid the transition back in to society. The contract will consist of a 6 month mobilisation period, to allow suppliers to secure accommodation, staffing and set up the service to ensure a smooth transition from the existing contract,
having minimal impact on the Service Users - followed by a 5 year contract, with the option to extend by up to 3 years. We anticipate that the services as detailed within the tender documents and supporting annexes will be no greater than £160m over the initial five year term (including mobilisation). The low and high contract values given include scope for: a) the option to extend the contract from 5 to 8 years; b) volumetric variations and c) legislative or policy changes. The scope of the contract is in line with current legislation, policy and projected volumes of Service Users. However, the resulting contract must be able to respond to changes, including value increases/decreases, and/or as yet unknown legislative or policy changes and volumetric changes, and the supplier must commit to being able to undertake the additional services and be able to secure the resources to do so.

Procurement and Legal Considerations

For the reasons set out above, the CCG plans to enter into a contract directly with the Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, East London Foundation Trust and the City and Hackney GP Confederation for a Neighbourhood Health and Care Alliance service.  However, the CCG requests that any other providers who would genuinely be capable and interested in providing the Neighbourhood Health and Care Alliance service within the CCG's desired timescales as described above submit an expression of interest by the 4 November 2019.    This will help inform the CCG's decision as to whether it will proceed with its proposed direct award. 

If the CCG receives no expressions of interest by the 4 November 2019, the CCG plans to award a contract under the provisions of Regulation 32(2)(b)(ii) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 and Regulation 5 of the National Health Service (Procurement, Patient Choice and Competition) Regulations (No.2) 2013.  For the avoidance of doubt, the receipt of expressions of interest from third parties shall not commit the CCG to carry out any further tender process, nor shall this notice constitute a formal call for competition under the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or the National Health Service (Procurement, Patient Choice and Competition) Regulations (No.2) 2013.

Any expressions of interest received by the 4 November 2019 will reviewed be an independent panel that will make a recommendation to the Governing Body about the decision on whether to proceed with the proposed direct award.
The services in the scope of this notice fall within Schedule 3 to the Public Contracts Regulations 2015(""the Regulations"") which are not subject to the full regime of the Regulations, but are instead governed by the ""Light Touch Regime"" (LTR) contained within Chapter 3, Section 7 of the Regulations (Regulations 74 to 77). The Authority does not intend to hold itself bound by the Regulations save those applicable to services coming within the scope of the LTR. In line with Section 75b of the Regulations, the Authority intends to make no further publication following this PIN prior to the award of contract/s for these services and interested parties are invited to express their interest in writing via the stated process by the deadline stated.

licence fee has funded and how they can access them to achieve maximum value from their licence fee. New
digital behaviours, particularly for younger audiences, means that it is becoming increasingly challenging to
reach young audiences solely through promotion on our owned media channels. Thus, it is essential, in order to
fulfil our responsibilities, that we use paid for media channels to complement our owned media.
The BBC is seeking a media agency to manage the planning, buying and return on investment evaluation of
external media activity, as well as delivering strategic insights and analysis of the wider emerging media market.
This is critical to ensure we deliver value for money to the UK public.
The maximum contract duration is up to 4 years, with the annual contract value incorporating both the paid
media budget and the fees payable to the agency estimated at 25 000 000 GBP.

For the BBC to meet its public service obligations, it is essential that all audiences are aware of the programmes
and services that we create. To ensure that we reach all audiences effectively, particularly younger audiences
who are spending less time on our owned platforms, we need to use paid for media alongside our owned media.

The MOD will be the Design Authority with the ability to procure system elements in a modular fashion via a disaggregated supply chain.

TAs will recommend to Highways England the best route option and then protect its technical interests throughout development and delivery phases of a scheme. The TA will act as an enabler in its relationship with the DIP, assisting Highways England to create the environment for project success. The framework will be divided into 6 lots, with each lot having a specific value threshold for schemes and covering a defined geographical area:
- lots 1 to 3 (Band A) are for schemes with a client budget of less than or equal to £100m and cover South West and Midlands (Lot 1), South East and Eat (Lot 2) and North East and North West (Lot 3)
- lots 4 to 6 (Band B) are for schemes with a client budget of greater than £100m and cover South West and Midlands (Lot 4), South East and East (Lot 5) and North East and North West (Lot 6).
There will be 1 tenderer appointed to each lot but there is no guarantee of any work or specific schemes from this tender process. Schemes allocated to a lot will be issued through a direct award to the successful tenderer for that lot or in circumstances specified in the procurement documents tendered as a mini-competition which may include the suppliers appointed to all lots. Successful tenderers may also have opportunities to win additional schemes in the rest of England in the circumstances specified in the procurement documents. Please note that the award of a scheme at PCF stage 1 does not guarantee it will proceed to PCF stage 7; a scheme can be withdrawn at any PCF stage in line with Highways England's governance procedures.
Highways England will not allow a TA for a scheme to also be the DIP (framework) Principal Designer for any given scheme. A Market Share rule will be applied to the value of work any one TA can undertake during the framework.

At the time of starting this procurement (July '19) the forward programme of schemes to be included in the TA framework is yet to be confirmed.

The Lot values have been set based on a 1:3 split between Band A and Band B and an even split between the Lots within each Band. The total framework value of £260m ensures sufficient contingency over and above the current estimated TA spend.

The key priorities will be to reduce unnecessary energy spend, tackle fuel poverty and support local energy generation. This will be known as the Southampton Tariff.

SANCTUARYLIVE001-DN410524-96971384,Contract,"Sanctuary Housing Group",Closed,2019-06-03T10:01:02Z,"Building Trades Contractor DPS","The general requirement is the establishment of a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) for Building Trades Contractors.  This DPS will provide Building Trades Contractors that will support Sanctuary's new build programme where we aspire to build 30,000 new houses, predominantly acting as subcontractors, and also directly appointed to undertake works on existing assets in terms of reinvestment and programmed upgrade works.  For a full list of trades and applicable regions required, please refer to supporting documentation available on Pro-Contract.

All potential suppliers will need to register their interest in the DPS on ProContract, and will then be directed to Constructionline to complete a Standard Selection Questionnaire (SSQ). Constructionline will assess whether suppliers meet the selection requirements and whether there is any reason why Sanctuary would not be able to enter a contract with them.  Upon acceptance, a contract (as provided in the tender pack for information) will be issued that will formalise that supplier's place on the DPS.  Once we have received the signed DPS contract suppliers will be eligible to tender for call-off contracts to provide services at our development sites. 

Steps for application:
1. Register interest and company details on Pro-Contract at www.sanctuary-tenders.co.uk.
2. Complete application process on Constructionline (http://constructionline.co.uk/products-services/dps-for-suppliers/sanctuary/)
3. Successful applicants will be notified accordingly and required to submit signed copies of the framework agreement, a copy of which is included in the tender pack.",,,"Any region","44211100 45210000 45262650 45300000 45421146 50610000 ","Group Procurement",group.procurement@sanctuary-housing.co.uk,"Sanctuary House, Chamber Court","Castle Street",Worcester,"WR1 3ZQ",England,"+44 1905334000",http://www.sanctuary-group.co.uk,,,,01/07/2019,31/05/2029,30/06/2019,NO,,Yes,No,No,Works,840000000,840000000,,,,,,,"Restricted ",

The Trust's intention is to deploy the core EPR system and incorporate the functionality of current specialist departmental systems, where possible. The Trust intends to achieve HIMSS Level 6 upon go-live and HIMSS Level 7 as soon as possible thereafter.
The Trust is not seeking an EPR development partnership for the vast majority of functionality required to meet specified OBS requirements. Rather, it requires tried and tested functionality, with HIMSS Level 6/7 accreditation, or equivalent functionality that has been successfully deployed in healthcare organisations of a similar size and nature to that of the Trust. Any proposal for an undeveloped or undelivered solution to meet specified requirements is very highly unlikely to be successful. 
The Trust reserves the right to amend the size and scope of the contract to:
-Add the specified optional and future requirements
-Reflect any future organisational changes that might be made to the Trust (or to successor organisations) which might mean that the contract/s should 'follow' the Trust to an evolved, or to a different, organisational entity
-Extend the scope of the contract/s to add additional partner Trusts
-Evolve, adapt and extend the design and development of the solution and services over time",,"GU16 7UJ","South East","48000000 ",,fhft.procurement@nhs.net,"Frimley Park Hospital, Portsmouth Road",,"Frimley, Surrey","GU16 7UJ",England,,,,"https://commercialsolutions.bravosolution.co.uk/ ","

The Authority has developed a set of Critical Success Factors (CSFs) which are aligned with its strategic objectives. The CSFs underpin the procurement programme and will help the Authority to achieve its future vision and are as follows:

-	Managing our risks: the continued success of Nest must have trust at its core.  Our customers need to trust that we can effectively look after their data and assets. It is vital that we can manage a smooth transition into our new scheme administration service and that once we are live, that service is robust and secure.
-	Enabling a commercially sustainable Nest: we are ultimately funded by our members.  Our new service must be delivered in a commercially efficient way that seeks to align our commercial interests, supports the long-term financial forecasts for the scheme and enables opportunities to maintain and grow sustainable revenue streams. 
-	Securing value for money:  We need to scope our services to fit the needs of our customers and deliver value for money over the life of the services including exit. We must run a competitive and legally compliant procurement. 
-	Improving customer outcomes: our vision is to help millions enjoy a better retirement.  Our new scheme administration services must focus on how advances in technology and deep data analytics ensure a joined up approach to continuous improvement and excellence in customer service.  This is so that we can help all of our customers to make the right choices and drive better outcomes.
-	Delivering services consistent with our values and capabilities: Nest is underpinned by the values of transparency, ease, empowerment and respect.  We want our future services to develop in alignment with these and work with a partner that understands 'what makes Nest, Nest' and can provide expertise that complements the capabilities that already sit within our organisation.",10/11/2020,09/11/2038,17/06/2019,NO,,No,No,No,Services,1500000000,0,,,,,,,"CompetitiveDialogueOJEU ",

The contract is a key operational service in maintaining a stable environment and supports the HMPPS decency agenda, which focuses on [normalising] aspects of prison life to prepare eligible prisoners for release.

The current solution is provided as part of a nationally managed service providing wholesale goods, logistics/fleet and management of multiple workshops (17 in total), located within prisons utilising 520 prisoners to pick, pack and despatch an estimated 66,000 orders a week. 

This project is looking at the re-procurement of the service and looking to hear from interested parties capable of providing the wholesale goods and/or the management of multiple workshops",,"LS1 4AP","Any region","55510000 ",,kevin.mcgilvray@justice.gov.uk,"102 Petty France",,London,"SW1H 9AJ",England,,,,,"
The primary objective of the service is to meet the demands of the paying consumers, providing a range of goods at prices comparable to that of convenience store retailers and responsive to the changing population demographics and external influences (e.g. healthy eating campaigns). The service aims to deliver orders in a timely, efficient manner while ensuring that prison security policies (national or local) are never contravened.
Financially a key aim of the service is that it is self-financing and that the service overheads are covered through the cost of sales. The service must not exploit the customer (prisoner) population and instead should be seen as an opportunity both to play a key role in the operation of a prison environment and also providing opportunities for re-skilling and resettlement on release (e.g. job interviews, offers of work). 
The information contained in this notice is indicative of current thinking and subject to change. ATTENTION: the value of this opportunity provided reflects the spend which is managed through the contract (the cost, overheads and margin AND sales), this is due to the self-financing nature of the service. 
The Project will be holding an open market engagement event at the Ministry of Justice ,5 Wellington Place, Leeds LS1 4AP on Thursday 16th May 2019 starting at 10am (registration from 9:30am). 
This is a follow up to the previous supplier engagement event held January 2018 and will be an opportunity for us to:
1. provide high level information on the project and our requirements;
2. openly answer questions (creating a common understanding of the project);
3. create networking opportunities for suppliers;

The morning will feature a presentation with open Q&A and the afternoon will be reserved for a small number of 1-2-1 meetings with interested suppliers. Details for requesting a 1-2-1 session together with a data capture questionnaire will be published on Bravo. Suppliers are encouraged to monitor the PQQ folder .
The project will, throughout the engagement process up to the formal procurement commencing, publish materials via Bravo, FAQs and other information to maintain transparency in engaging with the market. Suppliers are encouraged to monitor the PQQ folder (note: the PQQ function is being used for secure communication and is NOT an invitation or commitment to tender).

Leicester City Council is recommissioning its supported living services. It is anticipated, that tenders for the next set of supported living arrangements would be sought in November 2019 to enable new contract(s) to begin from November 2020. 
As part of the commissioning process, the Commissioners would like to undertake a soft market test. This gives potential providers and other stakeholders the opportunity to express their interests and feed in their views about the potential service model and service definitions. The commissioners will use the information to appraise options and further develop the specification. 
This process does not constitute a formal tender or other competitive bidding process and will not result in the letting of a Contract. The commissioners are using this process solely to test the market to gather information and ascertain the level of interest in this particular service. There are therefore no formal criteria which we will use to judge your responses, and it is not our intention to provide any feedback. 
To participate in this Soft Market Testing, interested organisations that may be interested in tendering at a later stage, either individually or as part of a consortium must complete a Soft Market Testing questionnaire. 
The questionnaire can be found by copying and pasting the following web link into your web browser:
https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=5f9dc577-d65a-e911-80f3-005056b64545

The framework also includes alternative technology platforms for managing the customers' recruitment processes.

ESPO will impose on economic operators requirements aimed at protecting the confidential nature of information made available throughout the procurement procedure (as permitted by Regulation 21(3)) and, before receiving that information, economic operators will be required to complete & return a Confidentiality Agreement, which will be available once economic operators have expressed an interest in the tender opportunity.

Lot 1: Managed Service Provision - Service provision where one Managed Service Provider takes responsibility for delivering recruitment services on behalf of the Customer, as an alternative to the Customer managing a framework of individual Agencies. Managed Services can often involve the Managed Service Provider operating a 'tiered' structure of Agencies to deliver the Services, dependent on the service model provided.

Lot 2: Vendor Management System - For Customers who are looking for a technology solution to help them manage recruitment Agencies, either on a self-service basis where recruitment is devolved to Hiring Managers, or via their own internal recruitment team. The system used will help Customers to manage their supply chain, and interact with Agencies & Temporary Agency Workers through the system in regards to ordering, timesheet reconciliation, compliance & management information

Lot 3: Talent Pool Technology - For Customers who are looking for a Talent Pool Technology Platform that they can contract with directly and either include within their existing MSP delivery model or develop as a stand-alone solution. A Talent Pool Technology Platform is an online database which allows a Worker to register, create, maintain & delete their own profile and be matched automatically to jobs put forward through the platform by Hiring Managers. The Talent Pool Technology Platform will be available via desktop and/or app. As such, Tenders will only be accepted for Lot 3 from Tenderers who fulfil the Talent Pool Technology Core Specification. Tenderers for Lot 3 Talent Pool Technology will own the intellectual property rights (IPR) and development of the platform.

The framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months. The total estimated value stated includes the option period. An eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.

agreement for the provision for New Build Construction Works.
Islington Council is seeking to appoint the highest 8 (eight) scoring contractors per lot to the
framework agreement. Contracts based on the framework agreement shall follow the terms of
the framework agreement including how a contract is concluded. How a contract is concluded
is explained within the invitation to tender documentation.
The framework agreement will utilise both direct award and mini-competitions to award to those
contractors successful on the framework.
The framework agreement can also be accessed and used by the London Borough of Hackney
and the London of Camden (participating authorities). The participating authorities can access
the framework agreement by entering into an access agreement with the London Borough of
Islington
Background and Description
The Council wishes to establish a framework agreement of contractors to enable it to
commission construction, refurbishment and associated works as and when required, on a
design and build basis and/or an intermediate with design basis and/or and intermediate without
design basis.
The framework agreement aims to attract and engage with contractors that are experienced in
new build refurbishment, repairs and maintenance work across different sectors including
residential, education, health, community and mixed use schemes to maximise the opportunity
for the Council to deliver best value.
The bulk of the work that will be procured via this framework will be for residential mixed tenure
new build projects. This could include refurbishment or conversion schemes that will be
procured either as part of a combined new build/refurbishment/conversion schemes or on a
stand-alone basis.
The scope of the works covered by the framework agreement shall include residential and non residential
new build projects. Works may cover new build/refurbishment/conversion works also
to education, health, third sector or other community buildings as well as non-residential
elements on a stand-alone basis or as a mixed use scheme if deemed appropriate by the
Council.
The scope will also cover roof top extensions and all construction works associated with this
type of development including, where considered appropriate, works to existing related
building/asset fabric, infrastructure or finishes to maximise the benefits and value for money to
the Council of such combined work and to mitigate the extent and duration of any
inconvenience to residents.
The Council is keen to promote the use of modern methods of construction under where it can
deliver benefits in value for money, quality, health, safety and mitigate inconvenience to
residents.",,,London,"45000000 ","Nuria Carrascosa",nuria.carrascosa@islington.gov.uk,"7 Newington Barrow Way",,London,"N7 7EP",England,"+44 2075278118",http://www.islington.gov.uk/,,,,01/10/2019,30/09/2023,07/05/2019,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Works,1200000000,1200000000,,,,,,,"Restricted ",

The services include: 
Lot 1: Provision of Independent Fostering Agencies (IFA) 
Lot 2: Provision of Residential Children's homes
Lot 3: Provision of Independent Schools and Education providers (ISEP) 
Lot 4: Provision of Out of School Tuition (OoST)
These services will be available to children and young people aged 0-18 (up to 19 for children and adults with Special educational needs and disability - SEND) in Cambridgeshire, neighbouring authorities and where directed by specific care plans, nationally. The successful Providers will be responsible for providing this service and liaising closely with the Contract Manager identified by the Authority.
The tender is led by Cambridgeshire County Council, however Cambridgeshire County Council and Peterborough City Council (PCC) have made strategic decision to combine roles and departments to manage services across both local authorities. Peterborough will have access to the DPS in their own right.
The DPS is open for an initial term of five (5) years commencing on 1st April 2019 and ending on 31st March 2024 with the options to extend for an initial period of two (2) years, then after further review, for another two-year-period to a final one (1) year extension (5+2+2+1), up to a maximum of ten (10) years from the date of the original contract date.
The anticipated spend across PCC and CCC for the duration of the DPS is £470,184,791.00. The spend is across the two local authorities for all four lots as listed above, however it is the local authorities' intention to reduce this spend through application of the new DPS, improving outcomes for individual children and the use of the mini competitions within the DPS over  its lifetime.

OXFS001-DN398852-26199443,Contract,"Oxfordshire County Council",Closed,2019-03-20T12:02:09Z,"Supported Transport Dynamic Purchasing Solution (DPS) CPU2014","Oxfordshire County Council ('the Council') invites Applicants to apply to join a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) for Supported Transport services.
The purpose of Supported Transport is to plan, procure and manage transport services that are required to transport members of the public to essential amenities in the county, such as mainstream and special schools and social care establishments. The service also facilitates transport for some isolated communities through community transport initiatives and its own Comet Bus. We also manage the concessionary fares scheme, which allows for free travel for the elderly and some disability groups.
The service typically procures over 1500 unique routes over the course of a year, ranging from procuring just a single journey to a long-term arrangement over several years. Longer term requirements for mainstream special schools range from 4 to 6 years. The maximum contract length including extensions is 8 years.
The Council is introducing a DPS to create a more efficient process for tendering Supported Transport. This will involve introducing an electronic system known as DPS where Applicants will pre-qualify via a Standard Selection Questionnaire (SSQ). Successful Applicants will be invited to tender for services during a Call-Off mini competition. The Service Categories covered by the DPS are:
•	Mainstream home to school transport;
•	Special Education Needs & Disabilities (SEND) transport;
•	Social Care transport

Services will mainly be required within the Oxfordshire boundary and in some cases within bordering counties. Out of county services for the Service Categories defined above will also be tendered through the DPS.
For more detailed information and guidance on the DPS please see the DPS Introduction and Guidance Document published with this SSQ.

The DPS period will be four years commencing on 1st July 2019.",,,"South East","60100000 ","Kay Appleby",kay.appleby@oxfordshire.gov.uk,"County Hall","New Road",Oxford,"OX1 1ND","United Kingdom",,http://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk,,,"

The Authority will use the feedback and responses from the market engagement events to help finalise its delivery models and specifications. Therefore, at this stage, the market engagement events are not part of any formal procurement process and therefore is not a call for competition. 

The formal procurement process is anticipated to commence later in 2019.

Participation or non-participation in the market engagement events will not prevent any provider from participating in any future procurement process, nor is it intended that any information supplied as part of these discussions will place any provider at an advantage in a potential procurement process.

Supported living services relate to the provision of both care and housing related support. Providers are not expected to source any accommodation for the service users. The supported living services will be provided for people with disabilities who live in a variety of settings (for example, shared rented or owned accommodation, individual rented accommodation, owner occupied property, extra care schemes or live with family carers or friends).

The Authority is holding two market engagement events, details of which are provided on the link below under Other Information Advert. The same two identical events are being repeated. 

Please feel free to attend, with prior booking request, any event which you are interested in or both the events.

To book a place at this event please email procurement-asc@leicester.gov.uk with the email Subject heading: SL ME Event. 
Please quote the Market Engagement Event Number; the date; the time of the event you would like to attend, together with the name of the attendee, their job title, and the name of their provider/organisation.

In accordance with Regulation 34 (18), the Council is extending the time frame for the evaluation of initial Requests to Participate to up to 6 weeks to carry out robust due diligence checks on Suppliers' suitability to be admitted to the DPS and on their economic and financial standing, and technical and professional ability.   
Under Regulation 59 we will also require documentary evidence to be submitted with Requests to Participate and at any other time to ensure the proper conduct of the procedure. 
The DPS is part of the Council's suite of transport arrangements and will be used for procurement of transport for both long and short term contracts, alongside other procurement methods. Suppliers should therefore note that the DPS will not be an exclusive arrangement and the Council may award transport contracts to other suppliers on any alternative basis.
The DPS will be divided into ""Lots"". The Lots are based on the different types of vehicle that the Council requires. The people requiring the Services will be children and young people attending mainstream schools, special schools and pupil referral units and Social Care service users (children and adults) and, potentially, other individual Council service users. The majority of Services will be delivered within the Council's administrative area but from time to time Services will also be required to be provided outside the Council's administrative area. 
The Lots are: 
1. 4 to 8 Seat Vehicles 
2. 9 to 16 Seat Vehicles
3. Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles
4. Specialist Transport Services (e.g. Ambulance, Secure Transport)
5. Emergency Transport (call off within 1 hour - 24 hour requirement)
6. PSV Passenger Transport Services (e.g. Home to School)
The Council cannot forecast likely demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPS is no guarantee that the Supplier will actually receive instructions from the Council to deliver Services. Suppliers may apply for appointment to as many Lots as they wish.
The DPS will operate for a period of five years commencing on or around 1st September 2019. The Council will have the option, at its discretion, to extend the period of operation of the DPS for a further period or periods of up to two years and reserves the right under Regulation 34 (28) to give notice of any changes to the validity of the DPS.

 The tender is led by Cambridgeshire County Council, however Cambridgeshire County Council and Peterborough City Council (PCC) have made strategic decision to combine roles and departments to manage services across both local authorities.

 The anticipated spend across PCC and CCC for the duration of the DPS is £470,184,791.00.

The procurement is using a bespoke approach similar to a competitive procedure with negotiation. In order to take part in the first round of negotiation meetings, potential bidders must notify the CCG of their intent to take part no later than 4pm on Tuesday 22 January 2019. Register at https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home.

The service will begin on 1 April 2020. The Contract will be for a period of up to 10 years. The indicative budget is £105m per annum. The CCG wants to ensure consistency across the geography. The CCG defines this as one provider delivering at least 85% of the Contract value itself.

The Contract will cover all core adult community health services, focusing on four overarching service specifications:

•	Integrated locality teams focusing on relationships with primary care through regular multidisciplinary team meetings to support people who have relatively stable needs to manage and reduce the risk of acute worsening of their condition. Access to community services will be through a single point of access.  
•	Urgent and reactive care teams working across localities to manage people who have acutely worsening conditions. This includes rapid response and has links to secondary care and community beds.  
•	Specialist advice and support has clinical staff knowledgeable about specific conditions such as diabetes and heart failure. There is an expectation that the community service will strengthen links between secondary care and primary care and ensure that patients, carers and professionals are empowered to better understand and manage the condition.  
•	Locality hubs are provided through physical building(s) and/or virtual connections of professionals within a locality that give people and professionals across a larger area access to services to support wellbeing and promote prevention and self-management. 
These four groupings combine services according to the level of complexity of people they support, all designed to help people to stay in the community.

The CCG wants to ensure a safe transfer of services so that from the start of the contract patients and carers experience as a minimum the same level of service that they have been receiving, with no gaps in provision. The Provider needs to become a long-term system partner, providing person-centred care, working closely with primary care leadership and being flexible to transition towards more integrated and innovative working during the life of the contract. The Provider needs to be part of Healthier Together, the Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP), work towards implementing the STP vision for an integrated care system and be willing to be part of a provider alliance with primary care localities.",,,"South West","85323000 ","Michael Pingstone",Michael.pingstone@nhs.net,"c/o NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group,","South Plaza, Marlborough St",Bristol,BS13NX,England,01179841614,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home,,"https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home ","This Contract Notice follows a Prior Information Notice released on 10th September 2018 and two market engagement events for potential bidders in 2018.

To support its ambitious plans, Bromford is seeking to procure a framework of Partners to deliver the coreaffordable housing developments for the Group, support Bromford in securing new development opportunitiesand share elements of risk on open market sale housing. Bromford aims to select partners that align with itsvalues and aspirations.
The Bromford Group covers a wide geographical area, predominately Central England and the SouthWest, which includes the West Midlands, Shropshire, Staffordshire, South Gloucestershire, Cirencester, theCotswolds, Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire and some areas of East Wales. Currently, Bromford's in houseconstruction company, Bromford Developments Limited (""BDL"") undertakes schemes in the northern area of thegeography, with the criteria being largely based on a travel time of 1 hour from Wolverhampton. It is thereforeexpected that the partners will work primarily in the South-West region, however Bromford will require flexibilityof location to ensure that the entirety of its geography is supported.
It is proposed that the framework will be divided into 3 lots as follows:
• LOT 1 will cover small developments (up to 20 units) of affordable housing;
• LOT 2 will cover medium developments (20 units or more) of mainly affordable housing with potential openmarket sales; and
• LOT 3 will cover large developments (100 units or more) of both affordable housing and open market sales ona shared risk and reward basis.
The Invitation to Tender (ITT) will set out further details in respect of how many suppliers are to be appointedto each Lot and how the work allocation / call-off procedures will operate. It is envisaged that most call-offcontracts will be directly awarded by application of the award criteria as set out in the ITT (anticipated to bePrice (40%) / Quality (60%)). Bromford will, however, retain the right to run mini-competitions across two ormore Lots as it sees fit and using a different Price / Quality split.

Bromford proposes to use the JCT 2016 Framework and Design & Build as a basis for the contract documents,with amendments to reflect the collaborative and open-book approach intended between Bromford and itspartners. Bromford may look to move towards using the NEC forms of contract as the collaborative nature of therelationships develop.

 - to make whatever changes it sees fit to the content and structure of the procurement process;

The Immigration enforcement directorate of the Home Office is responsible for the provision of escorting services and detention.
At any one time, approximately 3400 detainees are held overnight in one of the Immigration Removal Centres, residential Short Term Holding Facilities, prisons and police stations across the United Kingdom. In addition, persons can be detained for shorter periods of time in holding rooms at reporting centres, land and sea ports.
This often entails the provision of transportation for detainees and escorts who will travel with them to their final destination and hand them over to the appropriate authorities. This will include vulnerable detainees, (e.g. with a medical condition), as well as those who refuse to leave the UK voluntarily and those being removed on chartered flights.
The Home Office has sought a commercial partner for the provision of a number of distinct, but fully integrated services. These services include (but are not limited to):
- the escorting and transportation of detainees within the UK (In-Country escorting services),
- the escorting of detainees from the UK to and from an overseas destination (Overseas escorting),
- management of detainees detained at holding rooms and Short-term Holding Facilities (STHFs),
- operation and management of Short-term holding facilities.
The escorting and transportation of persons who are subject to the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 may also be required.

Delivered over 10 years, the Fund will deliver transformative change by focussing on those most at risk of involvement in youth violence, diverting young people away from becoming serious offenders.
The YEF will be key in supporting delivery against the ambition of the serious violence strategy, providing funding for early intervention, working with the grain of effective local partnerships, whilst improving the evidence base for what works. Our desired core outcome would be a reduction in proven offending with a particular focus on serious violent offending, in comparison to an appropriate control group.
To deliver this ambition, the Home Office will be launching a Call for Proposals (CfP) during the week commencing 10 December 2018, seeking to identify a suitably experienced organisation, consortium or partnership ('Bidder') who will have responsibility for managing the Fund itself and;
a.	deliver a programme of grants enabling interventions targeted at the desired cohort of children and young people in England and Wales;
b.	act as a centre of expertise, generating, disseminating and promoting new knowlege and practice that will transform local and national responses to tackling serious violence;
c.	ensure that evidence and knowledge is accessible to policy makers, service commissioners and front-line professionals on a free of charge basis;
d.	leverage impact by generating and securing additional funding and resources from appropriate sources and individuals to allow additional, longer term activity post the ten-year period; and
e.	provide annual reports to the Home Office covering take-up, quality of evidence produced and financial management including a cost benefit analysis of successful interventions.
Please note that the YEF is not aimed at organisations who may subsequently be interested in bidding for funding to support interventions once the Fund becomes operational. Further information for those with an interest in bidding for funding to deliver interventions will be made available once the Fund is operational, at an appropriate time.
Potential Bidders are invited to attend a briefing session to be held on 13 December 2018, at which further information will be provided about the Fund and the CfP as well as an opportunity to ask any questions. The briefing meeting will be held at a central London location. 
Bidders wishing to attend this event must register interest by emailing: YEFCompetition@homeoffice.gov.uk.

Instead of tendering for a service provider in the simplest form i.e. to deliver standard Hard and Soft FM Services, the Authorities have decided on a Strategic Asset Management approach to delivering this contract as a single supplier framework, where the intention is to enter into a call-off contract for a strategic partnership with a preferred framework partner for a long term arrangement, where all services under the banner of Hard FM, Soft FM and Asset Management might be included. It is intended that this framework would be open to local STP and other trusts or public sector bodies in England, however this is subject to the Authority agreeing access to the framework that is in line with its own strategic needs and purposes to facilitate and deliver services as required. In addition to this long term arrangement, there are multiple incremental options, which the Authorities will define during this procurement process, which may be utilised in the future across the Authorities or via other associated public sector organisations who might need the services and support of this framework, and as agreed with the Authorities from time to time.  Included in the strategic approach are a set of vested contract principles designed to facilitate and develop a true partnership approach, such as the ability for the preferred partner to 'earn' additional years of the contract relationship through over performance and exceeding expectations from the core contract minimum standards.  The two Authorities (CCST & CPFT) and their associated site information and data, will be utilised during the procurement process to enable the trust to call off from the framework on day one of the framework contract going live. There will be incremental options that the trust wishes to exercise and draw down from the preferred partner during the life of the agreement, however the bidders' solutions to the Trust's requirements will be developed through the dialogue process. The high level non-core and incremental options to form part of this framework are outlined in the tender documents.In respect of Partnering in a Joint Venture with the Authorities, there is an expectation that there might be risk sharing, investment, responsibility and reward in operating the services and potentially seeking new commercial opportunities to provide services to third party customers.The Authority, and any subsequent call off Authority, reserves the right to novate or assign any call-off contracts entered into to any subsidiary body established by the Authority to manage or co-ordinate their FM, Asset or development services requirements.Call-Off agreements under the framework may result in TUPE.The Authority will seek to recover the costs incurred in the establishment and management of this Framework.

The GLA expects to procure a range of adult training services resulting in multiple contracts for services, amounting to approximately £130m. However, this value could go up to £200m over four years, subject to the final AEB allocation to GLA confirmed by DFE. It is intended that successful providers will enter into individual contracts to deliver a range of education and training services to both in-work and out of work London residents aged 19 or above, to help them gain qualifications, progress into further education and ultimately access and sustain employment. The procured AEB funding will be used as match to some of London's European Social Fund (ESF) allocation. All AEB provision procured through this ITT will, therefore need to be compliant with the ESF regulations. 
The services contracts are intended to be split into two lots targeting different priority groups. These two priority groups, namely people out of work and people in work, will have different eligibility criteria and corresponding outputs and results. Applicants will be able to bid for one or both Lots and if awarded funding to deliver training services to both priority groups, this is envisaged to be under a single contract. It is envisaged that the contract notice will be published on 12 October 2018 with contracts to be awarded around April 2019 for training to commence on 1 August 2019.",,,London,"80000000 ","Nazir Fard",AEBProcurement@tfl.gov.uk,"55 Broadway",,LONDON,"SW1H 0BD",England,,https://www.london.gov.uk,,,"

The initial priorities will be to offer good quality cost effective residential care to meet the needs of Looked After Children (LAC) with complex behaviours and disabilities and to provide additional capacity to enhance edge of care services. The CPS covers the whole care system from point of entry in Children's Services to leaving care and aims to manage demand and provide the most cost effective placement and support services that deliver the best outcomes for children and young people. The Council wishes to enter into a collaboration agreement with an organisation or lead organisation acting for a consortium that can both design and deliver innovative services that provide improved outcomes for Leicestershire young people on the edge of care through to leaving care including children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND). The CIP will include 3 stages: design, delivery and evaluation. The Council expects the Partner to be able to bring its own financial or in kind contribution to the design stage and to the delivery stage to enhance the Councils statutory requirements in providing services to LAC and children with SEND. The Partner must have both the capacity to provide high quality advice and deliver major change in children's services. It is expected that the Partner will have the experience, expertise and quality standards to deliver the majority of services designed by the CIP and therefore must have a proven track record in providing children's services for edge of care, fostering, adoption, and permanence and care leavers. The estimated maximum annual value is £70,400,000 this is based on the 2018/19 budgets for the services covered by the CIP. The estimated maximum total value is £704,000,000 over 10 years. It is not intended that the full budget for each service area will be spent through the CIP. The Council will continue to use existing contracts and frameworks to purchase services. The scope and cost for each service delivered through the CIP will be agreed between the Council and the Partner as part of the design stage and will be within the budget envelope for existing services.

      - Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust (PHT)
      - Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust (SAL)
      - IOW NHS Trust (IOW)
      - One Dorset Pathology (Poole, Bournemouth and Dorchester) (ODP)
      
      Southern Counties Pathology is not currently a Legal Entity, but it is a procurement vehicle with the aim of delivering the early procurement objectives of the South 6 Pathology Network, which are: -
      - To enable the future formation of a consolidated pathology network over the next 5 years by standardising our suppliers and the equipment they supply us to deliver our High-Volume Routine Pathology Activity.
      
      - To make early cost savings by reducing the non-pay spend on our High-Volume Routine Pathology Activity and to enable us to improve our workforce efficiency and productivity individually within our services as currently configured.
      
      Southern Counties Pathology is therefore looking to: -
      - Procure a long-term strategic partnership with core Managed Service Provider(s) (MSP)
      - Appoint a single MSP provider to deliver a core managed service contract (MSC) for Lots 1 and 2 and to act as the Agent of the named Trusts for Lots 3 to 6, which will have their own MSC contractors.
      - Secure MSC providers who are committed to actively supporting SCP to achieve its reconfiguration objectives during the life of the contract.
      
      It should be understood that the members of SCP are not all at the same procurement point with some existing contracts having short and long-term periods still to run; therefore suppliers should expect implementation to be phased over the life of the MSC contract.

The Framework Agreement will include an option for it to be extended for a further 12 months in addition to the initial 3 year term upon review.  It is anticipated that between them, the providers will deliver in the region of 100,000 behavioural interventions per annum.   During the term, NHS England reserves the right, should funding become available, to increase the number of behavioural interventions per annum. The numbers of behavioural interventions may vary during the term of the Framework Agreement and these figures are estimates only, as precise quantities of likely purchases are unknown.

The primary aim of the Service is to prevent Type 2 diabetes. All aspects of the Service should be delivered by the Provider in accordance with the NDPP outcomes and with the aim of achieving three core aims: 
- Support people to achieve a healthy body weight, having appropriate regard to achievement of UK dietary recommendations related to fibre, fruit and vegetables, oily fish, saturated fat, salt and free sugars;  
- Achievement of the England Chief Medical Officer's (CMO) physical activity recommendations and a reduction in sedentary behaviour; and 
- To maximise completion rates of Service Users, including across groups that share a protected characteristic.

Expected NDPP outcomes
- Reduction in incidence of diabetes among Service Users as a result of the intervention;
-Reduction in weight of Service Users, where they are overweight or obese, and the maintenance of a healthy weight; and
- To reduce blood glucose parameters (HbA1c or Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)) in Service Users at 12 months and beyond.

As well as providing a face to face Service, the Specification for the Services requires Bidders to provide a remote digital service, where NHS England exercises its discretion to require a provider to deliver this.

The contract will cover the collection of dry recyclable, residual and biologically degradable waste from households and commercial properties, and the cleansing of streets and public open spaces, including beaches, as well as the service provision for the likes of Office Waste, Bulky Waste, Clinical Waste and other associated services. The Authority seeks to contract with a Services Provider that can actively manage materials used and discarded in Cornwall in a sustainable manner to improve the value of these services in Cornwall to all customers, and the cleanliness of the County. The Authority will require the successful Services Provider to implement a range of Social Value based initiatives to realize Socio-economic benefits.                              The current outsourced contract for 'Waste and Recycling Collection, Street and Beach Cleansing Services' will terminate on 31st March 2020, with the new contract anticipated to commence on 1st April 2020. It is envisaged this contract will have an initial term of eight (8) years with provision to extend by a further two (2) years, with the estimated term value of the Contract being approximately 20 000 000 GBP per annum.  The overall procurement process to be adopted will be the Competitive Dialogue process, consisting of an initial Pre-Qualification (PQQ) Stage (PQQ) stage to select Tenderers for ISDS (invitation to submit detailed solutions), followed by provisional ISRS (invitation to submit a refined solution) and ISFT (invitation to submit a final tender) stages, with no ISOS (invitation to submit outline solutions) stage. There will be down-selection at the PQQ stage and the ISDS stages and possibly at the provisional ISRS stage. The Services Provider will be selected from the ISFT stage. All ISDS, provisional ISRS and ISFT submissions will be evaluated and scores and constructive feedback will be provided to Tenderers at each stage. Dialogue will precede the provisional ISRS and ISFT stages. Of particular note, for waste collection, at the ISDS stage, the Authority requires the submission of detailed solutions for both of the following service provisions : 1. Mandatory solution: Weekly recycling and food waste collections with fortnightly residual waste collections (the Welsh waste collection model); or 2. Mandatory Variant solution: Weekly residual waste collections and fortnightly recycling collections (retaining the existing collection service). The Authority will evaluate both and anticipates making a decision during December, 2018, on its preferred solution to dialogue, based on affordability. Please refer to the ISDS Guidance Document for clarity over the use of the term 'Variant' in relation to this Procurement exercise.",,,"South West","90000000 90510000 90524100 90610000 90650000 90680000 90690000 ","Mike Shillaber",Mike.Shillaber@cornwall.gov.uk,"County Hall","Treyew Road",Truro,"TR1 3AY",England,"+44 1872322716",http://www.cornwall.gov.uk,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=d730db5a-66fc-e711-80ea-005056b64545 ","

Although the Bidders  can still submit an SQ response and get accredited on the DPS Lite,  there are no more contracts in the pipeline and there may not be any more opportunities to tender for. Updated 05 June 2018.

NHS England (London Region) (hereafter referred to as ""the Commissioner"") is seeking to re-commission Orthodontic services for London (""the Service""). 
The ambition of NHS England is to bring equity and excellence to the provision of care and treatment. 
NHS England are the Contracting Authority (hereafter referred to as ""the Authority"") for this procurement.
These service contracts are split into 40 Lots. (Please see the attachment provided in this advert for further details on the Lots).
The Commissioner reserves the right to change the Lot boundary in order to provide sufficient coverage across all areas in London. All the estimated contract values quoted are for the full term of 10 years, unless explicitly stated otherwise. 	
The published financial envelope for this service has been calculated on the basis of estimated activity levels. For the avoidance of doubt, while sufficient effort has been made to accurately estimate the activity levels and contract values, these are not guaranteed. Bidders should review the tender documents for more information.
The Procurement process will be facilitated entirely online via the e-procurement portal (https://procontract.due-north.com). All clarification requests and correspondence pertaining to this opportunity must be directed through the portal. 
A timetable for the procurement, guidance re: process, and supplementary information relating to each contract opportunity is also available from the Portal. 

The Contract awarded as a result of this procurement will be seven (7) years followed by an optional three (3) years' extension period. Therefore the maximum contract duration, if extended, will be ten (10) years. 01 October 2019 to 30 September 2029.

Neither the reference to ""Dynamic Purchasing System"",  ""DPS"" , ""ITT"", ""PQQ / SQ"", the use of the term ""Tender process"", nor any other indication shall be taken to mean that the Contracting Authority intends to hold itself bound to any of the Regulations, save those applicable to LTR provisions.
The DPS will remain open and valid from the start date to a period of two years, with the option to extend for a further two years at the sole discretion of the Authority. At any time during this period the bidders can request to get accredited. However, in order to be considered for the initial invitation to tender (for the PDS contracts starting in 2019), the bidders must complete and submit the first round of SQ by its published deadline.


Methodology used to calculate estimated annual activity across London is described as follows:
The number of UOAs per lot has been decided through a calculation which starts with the Orthodontic Needs Assessment (2017), which is then proportionally reduced to fit within the existing available financial envelope and which takes into account the level of GDS Orthodontic activity which is not affected by the procurement.
It has been proposed the national price range should be from £54.89 to £58.89 (£2 below and £2 above the benchmark price).The benchmark price of £56.89 is a reasonable national benchmark price 
It is well established that the cost of living, wages and operating within London is significantly higher than the national average. NHS England London considers that increasing the benchmark price by a 6.5% increase with a range £2 above and below the benchmark.
Contract holders will be paid in line with the Personal Dental Services Statement of Financial Entitlements.

898144484,Contract,"Leeds City Council",Awarded,2018-06-22T15:45:54Z,"Community Home Care Service"," This tender opportunity is for the Community Home Care service in the Leeds City Council area. The service specification sets out the range of Community Home Care services that the Council wants to make available, and the outcomes to be achieved as defined by the individual Service Users. The city will be split into 6 geographical areas, and one Primary Service Provider will operate in each of these areas. A framework agreement will also operate to supplement the primary contracts.  The Community Home Care services specified must be available to all people over the age of 18 who meet the Care Act 2014 eligibility criteria for funded support. However, the majority of people using these services will be older people. This Service responds to two significant developments in social care policy:  · A shift in focus from service inputs and outputs to the outcomes Service Users want to achieve  · That Leeds City Council promotes the introduction of Self-Directed Support through Personal Budgets, with people having more choice and control over the services they receive either through a Personal Budget or by ISF  Community Home Care is a simple way of describing the support that people receive to look after themselves and the homes they live in. The Specification incorporates Community Home Care for people who require an appropriate level of support and/or personal care and meet the Council`s eligibility criteria under: The Care Act, Care and Support (Eligibility Criteria) Regulations 2014 (the 'Eligibility Regulations'). The threshold is based on identifying how a person's needs affect their ability to achieve relevant outcomes, and how this impacts on their wellbeing.  The Specification introduces and requires new ways of working. The Council is keen to work with Service Providers to achieve the requirements in the Specification and to negotiate ways to deliver the specified outcomes. We welcome innovative approaches that add value and improve the quality of local, Community Home Care for people with eligible needs.  The contract will commence 1 st June 2016 for a duration of 5 years.  Please download the tender documentation for further information.

The contract will be split into 2 lots, Lot N: North East, North West, Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside and Wales, Lot S: East of England, London, South East and South West.
PECS4 contractors will continue to physically transport  prisoners between locations but increasingly the requirement will be to enable and support changes to the core operating model for courts, prisons and the police
resulting from the implementation of MoJ reform programmes, including an increased proportion of business being delivered in a virtual environment with greater emphasis on the use of video technology. PECS contractors will be responsible for the movement of adult males and females from prisons and police stations to courts as well as, inter-prison transfers, the movement of children and young people from Young Offender Institutions (YOIs), Secure Training Centres (STCs) and Secure Children's Homes (SCHs) as well as care and security whilst in the court custody area and in the dock, and transfers from courts to prisons and other nominated locations at the conclusion of court business.
The services will include:
- Escorting of adults and children and young people,
- At Court Care and Security,
- Inter Prison Transfers,
- Bedwatches for Children and Young People,
- Prisoner Welfare,
- Tornado and Mutual Aid,
- Incident Management,
- Audit and Quality Assurance.
Each service component (adult and children and young people) will be separately specified, funded and managed.
The anticipated quantity or scope is an estimate of the potential value of the contracts and does not in any way
guarantee any level of expenditure. The estimated cost range is real in 2018, does not account for inflation and
includes any possible future changes to the requirement for services as listed in additional information of this PIN. All values should be considered as indicative only.
The award criteria will be based on the most economically advantageous tender. Potential providers will be able to bid for both lots but will only be allowed to win 1 of the lots, unless there is only one bidder across both lots, in which case both lots could be awarded to 1 bidder. Potential providers will be required to state within their response to the Selection Questionnaire (SQ) the lots they want to bid for. If potential providers bid for both lots, they must be prepared to be awarded a contract for either lot, and must not state a preference.

bidders being ranked in 5th place, the Authority will take through all equally ranked bidders at this rank. If all
potential providers elect to bid for both lots, the maximum number of bidders to be shortlisted will be 5. Where the top 5 ranked bidders cannot be identified due to 2 or more bidders being ranked in 5th place, the Authority
will take through all equally ranked bidders at this rank.
3) Economic and financial assessment
Economic and Financial assessment will form part of the Selection Questionnaire on a Pass / Fail basis.
The Authority will be requesting updates to the information throughout the negotiation phase and should the
criteria set out in the 6.1.4.2 of the SQ Information and Background, not be met, the Authority will exclude
Potential Providers from the process. Further details of the Authority's approach are set out in the Selection
Questionnaire.

•	Support and Enabling Services include but are not limited to, community pharmacy support, home oxygen and wheelchair services and the management of community equipment. These services are integral to the delivery of health and care provision within the community, and must be responsive, adaptable and supportive.

The Mayor also wants the energy market to work better for Londoners, delivering fairer prices, helping them reduce their energy use and make the best use of smart innovations. The GLA procurement is open to innovative ideas that will deliver its desired outcomes and wants to establish a genuine collaboration with a company or consortium to achieve them. 
The Contracting Authorities seek to procure a fully licensed energy supplier to offer the supply of gas and electricity to all of London's residents using branding set up by the GLA under the Mayor of London's Energy for Londoners programme; and to undertake Voids Services for London Boroughs (LBs) and Housing Associations (HAs).

The key eight objectives are:
1. Competitively priced electricity and gas tariffs
2. Customer service and branding: Exemplary customer satisfaction 
3. Innovation: Innovating to help Londoners and especially those in fuel poverty to better meet their energy needs and budget for them.
4. Integration with other energy programmes
5. Data access: Provide access to all EfLSCo customer consumption data, for the GLA, LBs, contractors and research partners.
6. Financial: Generate a commission, without affecting the competitive viability of tariff structures.
7. Support the possible future transition to a fully licensed supplier or to another Service Provider.
8. Void Services: Support handling vacant properties, including installation of smart meters during void periods.

The Contracting Authorities are setting up a four (4) year Framework Agreement. The EfLSCo scheme will be delivered via a Call-Off from the Framework Agreement based on a four-year term, with the option for an extension or extensions of up to four more years. The LBs and HAs detailed may enter into Call-Off Contracts under the Framework Agreement for Voids Services. 
The procurement will follow the Competitive Dialogue procedure (under PCR 2015) to allow for the agreement scope and commercial arrangements to be developed and negotiated during the process, using an outcome based specification.  During this process, comments will be invited on draft framework and call-off contracts at Initial Tender.  Upon issue with the Final Tender, Framework and call-off contracts final terms must be accepted.
Securing and management of the EfLSCo customers will be handled by the Service Provider, and all interactions will be performed by the Service Provider's staff. The estimated turnover that the Service Provider would be able to generate across the four-year term is of the order of £279 million, including Voids Services.  If the GLA choose to extend the call-off arrangement for a further four years an additional £713 million estimated turnover may be realised.

ESPO proposes to establish a commercial trading company whose target clients will be third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier will be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with that commercial trading company on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.
The Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other procurement legislation. The trading company will enter into the framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.

"DWP_19023 1-6",Contract,"DEPARTMENT FOR WORK AND PENSIONS",Awarded,2018-02-20T14:27:57Z,"Work and Health Programme","The Work and Health Programme (WHP) has been designed in line with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) five key objectives as set out in the single Departmental Plan : 2015 to 2020, along with plans for how these will be achieved and measured. They are to:
• run an effective welfare system that enables people to achieve financial independence by providing assistance and guidance into employment;
• increase saving for, and security in, later life;
• create a fair and affordable welfare system which improves the life chances of children and adults;
• deliver outstanding services to our customers and claimants; and
• deliver efficiently: transforming the way we deliver our services to reduce costs and increase efficiency. 
DWP will always positively seek to improve and introduce efficiencies in its operations and delivery. DWP will work with the supplier where such improvements impact on processes associated with this Programme.
DWP currently provides additional employment support to those in (or at risk of) long-term unemployment through contracted provision. The largest such contracted provision is the Work Programme. Persons who have a disability with more complex issues are currently assisted by Work Choice, voluntary contracted employment provision which helps participants achieve and stay in employment.Referrals to both the Work Programme and Work Choice are scheduled to end in 2017. 
The economic climate and the labour market are considerably stronger than when the Work Programme and Work Choice programmes were designed and introduced. 
Given the current labour market conditions the reduced unemployment rate and the improved economic conditions, the contracted employment provision of the future can be smaller and provide more focused support. It will need to provide additional and more intensive support than Jobcentre Plus can offer and deliver sustained employment outcomes above a specified earnings threshold.
The WHP is part of a new Personal Support Package for people with health conditions and disabilities set out in the Work, Health and Disability Green Paper . Making progress on the manifesto ambition to halve the disability employment gap is central to the Government's social reform agenda of building a country and economy that works for everyone. 
The WHP will be DWP's new contracted employment provision that will help persons who have a disability, the long term unemployed (LTU) and specified disadvantaged groups to find sustained work. The WHP will target those who are most likely to benefit from the additional support of the programme and will:
• provide additional support that is distinct and additional to that available through Jobcentre Plus;

Tonbridge & Malling Borough Council (TMBC) and Tunbridge Wells Borough Council (TWBC) have been working in partnership with Kent County Council (KCC) to identify and implement cost effective waste collection/processing/disposal and street cleansing services within their respective Administrative Areas.

With regard to street cleansing, this Contract also seeks to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the service across the Administrative Area whilst addressing the differing needs and priorities of each authority.   
The Partner Authorities will award one contract for the above services to a single contractor across the two authorities for a term of 8 years with an option to extend twice; the first extension for either up to a further 2 or 8 years and the second extension for a period of up to 2 years but only if the contract has already been extended for 8 years.

It is envisaged this contract will have an initial term of eight (8) years with provision to extend by a further two (2) years, with the estimated term value of the Contract between 20 000 000 GBP per annum and 22 000 000 GBP per annum.

The Home Office Biometrics Programme (HOB) provides the biometric capability to support law enforcement, immigration, border security and UK passports (HMPO). It covers three primary biometric modalities: fingerprints, DNA and facial matching. HOB is responsible for two legacy national biometric systems (IABS and IDENT1) that provide this core biometric capability, each provided under contracts with clear duplication of components and functions. With the two contracts terminating in March 2019 (FABrIC for the IDENT1 system) and April 2019 (NBIS for the IABS system), neither can provide all of the capabilities required to achieve the HOB strategic objectives. This procurement is for a single service management capability, developing a Strategic and Central Bureau Platform (SCBP) as part of the Home Office Biometric (HOB) Programme.

The Contracting Authority intends to procure a single service management capability for the IABS and IDENT1 systems, developing a Strategic and Central Bureau Platform (SCBP) as part of the Home Office Biometric (HOB) Programme.

The contract duration will be for an initial term of six (6) years with an option to extend by two (2) years and then by a further two (2) Years (i.e.10 years altogether)
Estimated costs excluding VAT at 6 years are up to £198 million GBP, at 10 years up to £308 million GBP.

The scope encompasses service transition of core components for the IDENT1 and IABS systems to a single supplier with some service improvements. It comprises of:

-	Infrastructure support services as for the in scope subsystems, including working with the existing data centre provisioning and network supply.
-	Security support services for the in-scope sub-systems 
-	ITIL Service Management for the subsystems in scope as part of the wider HOB and Authority ecosystem 
-	Development, testing and deployment of changes. These changes will be commissioned by the Authority in support of the known pipeline of work and change. 
Additional requirements, defined as Scenarios, which may be taken up during the term: 
-	Data centre consolidation into two data centres through relocation away from the existing IDENT1 production Data Centres into the existing IABS Data Centres 
-	Migration of both IDENT1 and IABS applications into a Public Cloud hosting environment

LGSS001-DN313501-20912979,Contract,"Cambridgeshire County Council",Closed,2017-12-20T14:40:55Z,"Cambridgeshire County Council Strategic Partner for New Residential and Nursing Care Home Provision","Cambridgeshire is facing an increasing challenge to meet the current and future needs of its expanding population of older people. There are significant pressures on the Council's statutory services and accommodation provision for older people, which is in turn putting pressure on financial budgets. With increases in population and inflation there will be a significant shortfall in suitable accommodation if the way in which services are delivered do not change. The Council must therefore transform its accommodation strategy for older people.

Cambridgeshire County Council has identified a significant shortage of residential and nursing care provision throughout the County. As a result of this, an options appraisal was carried out and the need to appoint a strategic Partner(s) to deliver new provision within the County was identified.

The Council wishes to appoint one or more strategic partner(s) or a consortium of partners to design, build, operate and maintain new residential and nursing care provision within Cambridgeshire against the vision and outcomes set out in this document, with the partnership(s) commencing approximately January 2019. 

It has been identified there is an immediate need for 450 additional bed capacity within the market, this is shared between Council funded and self-funded placements with demand for 125 affordable nursing/ nursing dementia placements and 25 affordable residential dementia placements funded by the Council, and 300 self-funding and health placements. These 450 beds are required to come online as soon as possible.

The aim of this procurement is to create this additional capacity by building new care homes on land provided by the Council with a third of all new provision to be made available to the Council at affordable rates.  The number of suitable sites available and number of care homes required is yet to be determined. 

This procurement will consist of three Lots:

-	Lot 1 - North Cambridgeshire (Huntingdonshire, Fenland and East Cambridgeshire)
-	Lot 2 - South Cambridgeshire (Cambridge City and South Cambridgeshire)
-	Lot 3 - Cambridgeshire as a whole

Bidders are invited to express their interest in any or all of the 3 Lots. Please note that the Council reserves the right not to award any Lot and will not award Lot 3 if it makes an award under Lot 1 and 2 or not award Lot 1 or 2 if it makes an award under Lot 3. Further information on expression of interest and award of Lots is included in outlined below.

Participation is open to any residential and nursing care provider(s) and/ or developer(s) who have previous experience of developing and/ or operating care homes for older people.  

The successful strategic partner(s) (or consortium of partners) will demonstrate the expertise to design, build, operate and maintain new residential and nursing care home provision for older people across the County.",,,"East of England","45000000 85000000 ","David Isaacs",david.isaacs@cambridgeshire.gov.uk,"Shire Hall","Castle Hill",Cambridge,"CB3 0AP",England,"+44 1223703518",https://www.lgss.co.uk/about/,,,"
It is anticipated that the care provision contract will be a block bed arrangement and will be in place for 15 years with two possible extensions, each of 5 years.  

The cost for 150 affordable Council funded care placements, based on current long-term market rates, would equate to approximately GBP 3.6m per annum. The value of the care provision over the proposed 25 year contract term (15 years + 5 years + 5 years) can therefore be estimated as follows;

Lot 1: 75 Affordable Beds = GBP 50million
Lot 2: 75 Affordable Beds = GBP 50million
Lot 3: 150 Affordable Beds = GBP 100million

It is intended that the Council will enter into a long lease arrangement with the provider(s) for the land provided and enter into a separate care provision contract with the provider(s). 

It should be noted, that during the term of the contract, Peterborough County Council may require new care home provision to be built which may rely on this arrangement, although this is yet to be decided. Any such new care home provision within Peterborough would be addressed under Lot 1.
It is intended that the Council will enter into a formal Competitive Dialogue process with the market in order appoint a strategic partner (s) (or a consortium of partners) to design, build, operate and maintain new residential and nursing care home provision for older people across the County.

The Council intends to embrace the opportunities that Competitive Dialogue provides to all parties during this procurement process and wishes to engage in open and constructive discussions with all bidders regarding the development of their proposals. The aim of the dialogue is to identify and define the means best suited to satisfy the Council's need for a strategic partner(s). 

The Council requires interested parties to complete a Supplier Qualification Questionnaire (""the SQ""). Following evaluation of the SQ submissions, the four highest scoring bidders (per Lot) who pass the SQ threshold of 55% will qualify to participate in the Invitation to Participate in Competitive Dialogue (ITPCD). Please see the SQ Guidance document for more information. 

The Council will incorporate three distinct stages for the CD: 

-	Outline Solution Stage (incorporating the Invitation to Submit Outline Solutions ""ISOS"")
-	Detailed Solution Stage (incorporating the Invitation to Submit Detailed Solutions ""ISDS"")
-	Final Solution Stage (incorporating the Invitation to Submit Final Solutions ""ISFS"").

Cambridgeshire County Council intends to award a contract for the design, build, operation and management of new care home provision to one strategic partner (or consortium of partners) per Lot for Lots 1 and 2 OR one strategic partner (or consortium of partners) for Lot 3.

Bidders are invited to submit a bid for either one, two or all three of the Lots. 

Please note that if a Bidder wishes to submit a bid for Lot 1 AND Lot 2 (South Cambridgeshire), and would also be interested in delivering services across the whole of Cambridgeshire, the Bidder MUST also express an interest in Lot 3 (Cambridgeshire as a whole).

Bidders who DO NOT select Lot 3 as an option will only be considered to deliver services in either Lot 1 OR Lot 2.

Bidders who have ONLY selected Lot 1 and/ or 2 (and not Lot 3) will ONLY be able to win EITHER Lot 1 and/ or Lot 2.

Please note that Bidders who express an interest in Lot 3 will be subject to a higher financial Qualification threshold. 

Should a Bidder fail to meet the requirements of this higher level of financial qualification required for Lot 3, and has indicated an interest in all three Lots, they will only be considered for Lot 1 and 2.

The Authority reserves the right to;
-	award the contract to either one or two Bidders.
-	choose not to award a contract under any Lot as a result of the procurement process
-	remove or add Lots at any time during the procurement process.
Bidders  should note that the closing date for SQ submissions is 12:00:00pm (noon) 26th January 2018. A threshold pass mark of 55% will be applied at the PQQ stage. Only Potential Provider organisations who achieve a mark of 55% or more will have their submissions evaluated at the following ISOS stage (Invitation to Submit Outline Solution). Bidders that fail mandatory pass / fail questions will be deemed non-compliant and their submission will not be considered any further.

The successful Supplier will be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with that commercial trading company on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.

The Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other procurement legislation.  Trading Company No 1 will enter into the framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other procurement legislation.  Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.

A second company will be contracted by ESPO to manage and administer the first framework agreement for ESPO in relation to certain contracting authorities.  This company will not affect the contractual relationship with the successful bidder save to the extent that the company will be responsible for the marketing and administration of the framework agreement and will also, at the election of ESPO, be able to collect a proportion of the Retrospective Rebate in respect of the work it does.  The framework agreement will not otherwise change and customers will call off service contracts directly with the Supplier.

Delivery of these private and public sector projects will generate many benefits to the Borough, including:- 

•	Additional tax revenues to support the Council's Medium Term Financial Strategy;
•	Accelerate economic activity to create employment opportunities for residents;
•	Support growth and vitality in the town centres of Blackburn and Darwen;
•	Generate financial benefits from strategic land receipts; and
•	Extend the choice and range of new family housing to attract new residents into the Borough.

The Programme identifies sites across the Borough which utilise private or public sector land and cover employment, housing and town centre developments. The procurement of a new Contractor and Development Framework will help support this Programme by bringing forward Projects for the construction of building and infrastructure schemes or commercial development on public sector owned sites.
The Council is therefore seeking to establish the Framework with partners who will work with the Council and other public sector clients that may use the Framework in delivering Projects across Blackburn with Darwen and the wider Lancashire area. The Framework is intended to be used for the procurement of works and services in delivering a variety of Projects covering building construction, civil engineering and commercial developments. 

The Framework will include all activities necessary to deliver completed developments, buildings and infrastructure, including acquisition or disposal of land for development, development or project finance; obtaining statutory permissions including planning permission; supply chain procurement and management, design services, construction works, marketing and sales. 

Typical schemes to be procured through the Framework may include education buildings, leisure facilitates, retail schemes, commercial development, elderly accommodation, mixed use schemes and construction of supporting infrastructure, roads, site remediation, demolition and other enabling works necessary to prepare sites ready for future development or disposal.

The Council is seeking to establish a framework of delivery partners who will work with the Council and other contracting authorities who may decide to take advantage of this framework.

The JV arrangement may involve services, works or supplies being developed and delivered and commercial opportunities taken forward over the next 20 - 30 years in a number of sectors: Energy, Transport Food, Waste and Water.

There will be a Framework Contract with a single supplier appointed to deliver the FVD, related Accessories and to provide support services (e.g. repair, warranty services and software and firmware updates). All ESN Devices must operate the 3GPP Release 12 QoS Class Identifiers (QCIs incorporating public safety features) to enable them to be fully capable of operating on the ESN LTE network and meeting user organisation requirements, which will be detailed in the ITT documents and specifications. This opportunity is therefore restricted to those suppliers who are able to demonstrate their capability and experience to design and develop a device of the type required by this procurement to deliver the FVD and accessories.

The FVD must achieve Network Approval Testing Service (NATS) and User Device Type Approval Service (UDTAS) accreditation as part of the requirements to operate on the ESN. This will be explained further in the tender documents. The Contract will be awarded for a duration of 36 months plus the option for the Authority to extend for two further periods of 12 months.
The supply will include:
a. Product Design and Development - The initial part of the contract will be for the design and development of a FVD in accordance with the requirements as provided. The design and development phase will include discrete milestones to include Design Completion, Prototypes, Accreditation and Testing and final sign off of production Devices. 
b. Vehicle Devices for Trials - The Authority will require a number of production-standard FVDs for use in live trials. The order for Trial Devices will be made by the Authority under the terms of the Framework Agreement Call-Off Schedule.
c. Vehicle Devices for User Organisations - On completion of the Operation Trials, User Organisations will be enabled through this Framework Agreement to call off production-standard FVDs for their own use on the ESN network. Orders will be made by the User Organisations during the term of the Framework Agreement subject to the Call-Off Procedure in the Framework Agreement.
d. Accessories Catalogue - The supply of COTS accessories and ancillary devices which are to be used with the FVD and other devices within ESN. This Accessories Catalogue is to include COTS ancillary equipment such as interface units, audio accessories, driver safe controls and user interface units. This catalogue will be used by User Organisations to call off ancillary equipment separately from the call off for the Fixed Vehicle Device. The catalogue is likely to be required by the Authority for Trials and by User Organisations in advance of completion of the FVD design and development phase.

The procurement was substantially oversubscribed and the outcomes of that competition would not have delivered the diverse market sought whilst giving the sector as a whole stability in the transition to the apprenticeship service. That procurement is now closed and no awards will be made under it. It is therefore essential that those Potential Providers who submitted tenders in the previous procurement and who continue to wish to be considered for delivery of the Services, respond to this new procurement in accordance with the terms set out in the ITT  and the accompanying Attachments. This new procurement has been designed to ensure that government can better meet its objectives, and deliver high quality apprenticeship training to support the growth and success of SMEs that play such a vital role in our economy. It will do this by seeking to deliver a stable transition between now and April 2019, when we aim to bring all employers, including those who do not pay the levy, onto the apprenticeship service.

AASC,Pipeline,"HOME OFFICE",Closed,2017-07-27T16:18:05Z,"Asylum Accommodation and Support Services Contract","Under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, UKVI has an obligation to provide accommodation & support to asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute.
The service user support services will include the provision of:

Accommodation
Accommodation is provided to support asylum applicants and their dependents who would otherwise be destitute. Accommodation is to be provided by the service provider(s) covering a number of regions in the UK. Accommodation provision is through local authorities, private and other accommodation providers e.g. housing associations. Accommodation is paid for on the basis of usage only, with the provider taking the void risk.
Three types of accommodation services required are:
1.	Initial accommodation where a destitute asylum applicant and their dependents will reside before a decision is made on their support claim. 
2.	Dispersal accommodation where an asylum applicant's claim for asylum support has been approved, they and their dependents are moved to dispersal accommodation whilst their asylum claim and any subsequent appeal are processed.
3.	Accommodation for failed asylum applicants and immigration detainees released on bail who may be eligible for support if there is a legitimate barrier to their removal.

Transport
Transport is provided for asylum applicants and their dependents during their asylum application process to ensure they arrive at required destinations for interview appointments. 
Service users needing accommodation are transported from the point of claim to the allocated site on the initial accommodation estate.
Once a claim for support has been agreed the service users are transported from initial accommodation to the assigned dispersal address.
Project Vision
Asylum Accommodation and Support Contract aims to deliver a VfM and affordable accommodation and support system which effectively delivers the UK's statutory and international obligations to asylum seekers, supporting the operation of effective immigration controls. 

The system will ensure the safety and security of service users and their host communities. Services will be delivered as consistently & efficiently as possible at a level which is proportionate in comparison with the services offered to UK nationals:  
•	Service users will experience an accessible and easy to navigate system, which delivers consistent and compassionate support. The system will protect the vulnerable, keep service users safe, orientate them to live in their communities and prepare them to act on the outcome of their asylum claim.
•	Providers will supply a service of which they are proud, securing a broad supply of accommodation and appropriate support services. The department will take practical steps to give them greater certainty on demand, with a sustainable balance of risk, an appropriate rate of return and scope for innovation in delivery.
•	Communities will feel involved in the support of destitute asylum seekers, working in partnership with UKVI.",,,"Any region","55250000 60112000 60120000 60130000 60140000 70330000 79900000 85144000 85300000 98334000 98341000 ","AASC Procurement Team",aascprocurement@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk,"The Secretary of State for the Home Office Department (UKVI)","2 Marsham Street",London,"SW1P 4DF",England,,http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office,,"http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:289909-2017:TEXT:EN:HTML&src=0 ","The contract end date is to be confirmed in due course.",01/09/2019,30/08/2024,07/11/2017,NO,,No,No,No,,600000000,0,,,,,,," ",

      In planning for the future, the Ships Operating Centre is driving forward a Common Support Model, transforming support delivered to all complex warships by a converged, high performing, cost effective support model underpinned by a common approach to class, design and equipment management.  The aspiration is to have the Common Support Model in place in time to support the Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carriers and Type 45 Destroyers from the end of November 2016.  
      As part of the Common Support Model, MPS is planning to transform its organisation structure and ways of working from equipment to systems lines, by implementing its new Marine Systems Hub (MSH).  To support its implementation of the MSH, and in view of the timelines to support QEC/T45, MPS is considering contracting for one or more Support Partners, who will be responsible for working alongside the MOD team to provide a range of services covering spares, systems repairs and post design services (including provision of technical SQEP) for maritime platform equipment. The support will primarily cover T45 and QEC but legacy equipment may be incorporated in the future, and as appropriate, future warship and submarine platforms in the Fleet. 
      In view of the diverse nature of the equipment MPS has described this requirement as 4 systems - Power & Propulsion; Environmental, Domestic & Habitability; Platform Systems; Mechanical & Constructive; allowing a maximum of four contracts to be placed. A single contract may be placed if all four systems are awarded to one company as they provided the Most Economically Advantageous Tender for each System.
      The potential contract/s will be placed with Platform Systems Support Partner(s) who will be required to undertake Engineering and Logistics support activities for T45/QEC Systems and Equipment and will discharge these responsibilities as part of the Systems Technical Authority (STA).  The role of the STA is to provide guidance and advice to the MPS Systems Approving Authority (SAA), who has responsibility for ensuring system integrity on behalf of the Platform Safety Duty Holder.  
      
      The STA will provide assurance to the SAA:
      •	that design change has been holistically integrated into the relevant system; 
      •	provide evidence-based assurance to the SAA that the solution meets the Design Intent at the system level; 
      •	Supports Ships OC Duty Holders in diagnosing system failures and providing an emergency response service to the Navy on constraints to be placed on operational activity when using systems outside their design intent; and 
      •	Identifies opportunities for improvement of system design.
      
      In some instances the Authority may consider delegating the equipment approving authority role to the STA.",,,"South West","71336000 35522000 50640000 71356300 35520000 ","Paul Houston",julia.filer340@mod.gov.uk,"Birch 3A, #3320, NH3","Abbeywood South",Bristol,"BS34 8JH",UK,+443067934173,,,,"To view this notice, register as a supplier here:

The Authority is conducting the procurement using the Competitive Procedure with Negotiation procedure (CPN).

The Authority proposes to enter into a Contract for a maximum period of two years with the successful Tenderer (Service Provider), with an option to extend for a period or periods of up to a maximum of 12 months.  Such extension will be at the discretion of the Council and subject to satisfactory performance.

The anticipated service commencement date is July 2017.

This service specification sets out the requirements for targeted youth service provision. The programme aims to deliver 'open access' venues, to cast as wide a net as possible to engage young people, but with a clear focus on increasing targeted early help support and intervention for those young people in greatest need and at the greatest risk of poor outcomes.
 
The service will be divided into the following lots:
Lot 1.	Targeted Early Help youth provision, in open access venues, in the East of Hull.
Lot 2.	Targeted Early Help youth provision, in open access venues, in the West of Hull.
Lot 3.	Targeted Early Help youth provision, in open access venues, in the North of Hull.
Lot 4.	A city-wide Targeted Early Help Street Based and Outreach programme for vulnerable young people at risk of poor outcomes.
 
The Authority is looking for a minimum of 3 providers to deliver services against each of the sub-lots (Lots 1-3), and one provider to deliver Lot 4.
 
The Authority encourages consortia to deliver the contract for in order to provide value for money and the added value partnership working can bring.
Under this contract the Supplier will be required to actively contribute to the achievement of social objectives. These include: skills development; employment and training opportunities within the locality of where the contract will be delivered; and other added value initiatives throughout the supply chain to support community programmes promoted by the council. Accordingly contract performance conditions may relate in particular to secondary considerations.
