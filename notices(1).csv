         ASDOT is a Category ‘A’ programme and under current planning assumptions may be delivered in incremental phases – Phase one will be introduced from 2020 for 15 years and the estimated value is approximately £750 Million. Phase two could add another £300M-500M over the remaining 8 years. 
Description of Procurement
The scope of the ASDOT programme currently covers provision of live flying assets to meet the following training requirements:-
• Air to Air Combat
• Air to Surface Combat
• Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC)/Forward Air Controller (Airborne) (FAC(A))
• Electronic Warfare
• Air Traffic Control (ATC), Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD) and Aerospace Battle Management (ABM)
• Live Gunnery
The ASDOT team is currently working towards an Investment Decision by the end of 2016. Under current plans, a competition for this requirement under the Negotiated Procedure will be launched with the release of a Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ). At this time it is envisaged that a single 15 year contract will be let covering the delivery of the requirement through a phased approach. It is important to the Authority that as many interested parties be given the opportunity to understand and consider ASDOT ahead of formal engagement and therefore an Industry Day is planned, at a date to be advised, this will be an opportunity for potential suppliers to learn more about the requirement document.
Some Industry engagement has already taken place during the Concept Phase through the Niteworks Partnership and the Authority now invites companies wishing to learn more about this requirement or offer views on contract duration, phasing and performance measures, technology insertion points and capability enhancements, to contact the Project Team which would be happy to engage.
This PIN is to alert the market to this potential future requirement and is NOT a formal request for Expressions of Interest (EOI). A Contract Notice and Dynamic PQQ may be issued at a date after the Industry Day to request EOIs which shall reference this PIN. 
Enquiries should be sent by email to: DESUKMFTS-ASDOT-Cmrcl-Industry@mod.uk

The project is funded through the European Development Fund (ERDF) and runs to June 2020.  

This tender specification sets out the key deliverables for the development of an evolutionary study, director plan and management plan that is centred on the range of industrial and maritime heritage assets located along Liverpool's iconic waterfront.  It also sets out the scope of requirements for the delivery of the final plans and specifies the timescales within which the activity must be completed.

The Military, Maritime and Industrial Atlantic Heritage Project (MMIAH) is funded through the Interreg Atlantic Area ERDF programme and will run for three years and commenced in July 2017.  The project has nine city partners from the UK, Northern Ireland, France, Republic of Ireland, Spain and Portugal.  

The specific objectives of the project are focused on the recovery and rehabilitation of abandoned military or industrial heritage sites relating to the sea for tourism and the benefit of local communities.  Comprising 7 work programmes, the project will fund a programme of research and development activity to establish those sites that offer the greatest potential in this regard.  It will also support the creation of operational and maintenance plans for each city that will help support the detailed development of the assets that have been prioritised.

Through a range of pilot intervention plans, the initiative will also support projects in agreed locations that will encourage local resident engagement in local military, maritime and industrial heritage (MMI), as well as repurposing them for tourism.  Finally the project seeks to develop best practice for the development of MMI and at its conclusion, will have established a joint use-planning model and management model that can be transferred and implemented in other cities.",,,"North West","73210000 73220000 ","Natasha Mealor",natasha.mealor@liverpoollep.org,"1 Mann Island",,Liverpool,"L3 1BP",England,"0151 227 2727",https://www.liverpoollep.org,"TENDER BRIEF - Interreg WP4  WP5 23080818 (003).docx Appendix A - WP4 Methodology for the analisys and evolutionary study.odt Copy of Appendix B - MMI Inventory.xlsx Appendix C - Examples of Good Practice Liverpool LEP.pdf ","https://www.liverpoollep.org/tenders/ ",,11/09/2018,15/02/2019,07/09/2018,YES,T001,Yes,Yes,No,Services,1,35600,10/09/2018,34378.8,"[Chris Blandford Associates Ltd|The Old Crown

AFPRB provides independent advice to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Defence on the remuneration and charges for Armed Forces' personnel. In reaching its recommendations, AFPRB takes account of: the need to recruit, retain and motivate suitably able and qualified people taking account of the particular circumstances of Service life; Government policies; the MoD's budget; and the Government's inflation target. It must also consider the need for the pay of the Armed Forces to be broadly comparable with pay levels in civilian life.
3.	X-Factor is a pensionable addition to basic military pay intended to reflect the disadvantage in conditions of service experienced by members of the Armed Forces compared with civilians; it is currently set at 14.5 per cent. X-Factor takes account of a range of components, but is not linked to mechanistic formulae. The rate tapers for more senior Officers (Colonel equivalent and above) as it was felt that those personnel were less affected by some aspects of the X-Factor. In addition, parts of AFPRB's remit group are entitled to lower levels of X-Factor, such as Reserves and Military Provost Guard Service. AFPRB is responsible for the structural aspects of X-Factor including its make-up, application and level. It is reviewed every five years unless AFPRB decides earlier review is appropriate.
7.	The aim of this project is to inform AFPRB's review of the X-Factor in 2017, ahead of its report in 2018. The project will provide an assessment of the X-Factor components as they relate to the civilian sector. Data relating to the military sector will be collected and assessed elsewhere and will not form part of this project. The two sets of data will be presented to AFPRB to inform their review.

8.	The objectives of this exercise are to:
•	Identify and provide quantitative data for the civilian sector relating to each of 
component factors. Data to cover the period from 2012-2017;
•	Identify credible alternative data sources as a contingency in case those used previously are no longer available/out of date; 
•	Advise OME of appropriate sources of additional or alternative qualitative data;
•	Provide OME with an analysis of these data, as they relate to the civilian sector, an assessment of how they have changed since 2012, and an assessment of which components are the most highly valued in the civilian sector;
•	Provide OME with an assessment of which of these data sources are likely to be available for use in future reviews of X-Factor.",,,"Any region","73200000 79300000 ","Rebecca Fish",research@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House","North Star Avenue",Swindon,"SN2 1ET",England,,,"Bidder_Training_V1.0.pdf Bidder_-_Logging_into_Emptoris_for_the_first_time_V1.0.pdf FINAL ITQ Invitation to Quote BLOJEU-CR17065OME.pdf FINAL ITQ Invitation to Quote questions BLOJEU-CR17065OME.pdf Services purchasing contract BLOJEU-CR17065OME.pdf AW5.2 Price Schedule - BLOJEU-CR17065OME.pdf ",,"The final date and time for the submission of bids is 29/06/2017 at 14:00

BACKGROUND

In April 15 the MOD signed a contract with Leidos Europe Ltd to provide the procurement and inventory management of commodity items (as well as the storage and distribution services) historically provided in-house by the Logistic Commodities and Services Operating Centre. Leidos, working with the MOD, will transform the way these services are delivered to ensure requirements continue to be met whilst providing best value for money for the department. The organisation delivering these services is known as Team Leidos.

FUTURE ARRANGEMENTS

Further to our Request for Information (RFI - first issued 22.08.2019) for Diagnostic Ultrasound Devices (DUS - reference LSL/MED/0063), Military Radiology Specialists within both the Emergency and Secondary Health Care environments have expressed an interest in seeing a broader range of devices as part of our upcoming Industry Day. 

The Industry Day has been scheduled to take place on the 17th October 2019 at the address listed below. Please contact Team Leidos for booking confirmation using the following details:

Contact person: Konstantin Nikolov

Industry Day Information - Thursday 17th October 2019

Address 
RAF Brize Norton
Main Gate 
OX18 3LX.

Arrival Time 
From 08:00 - Suppliers will be required to check in with Security at the Main Gate and obtain a pass before being directed to allocated parking.  

Duration
The event is scheduled to start at 10:00 and finish at 15:00. 

An exact itinerary for the day including updated running times, and information required in advance for access to site, will be provided to confirmed attendees closer to the event. 

UPDATE FOLLOWING RFI RELEASED 22.08.2019

Team Leidos' original intention was to plan an Industry Day to reflect the requirement for DUS devices only (for use in Regional Rehabilitation Centres). Whilst there have been no changes to the DUS requirement (Ref-LSL/MED/0063 - referenced within the PIN issued 08.08.2019 or subsequent RFI released 22.08.2019), the scope of the Industry Day has widened to include viewing a broader range of devices. 

To this end we would like to invite suppliers to showcase devices with the capability to provide Pre Hospital Emergency Care (PHEC) within a range of military environments. It's our intention to furnish a wider audience of Military Radiology Specialists with enhanced industry knowledge, to help with the development of future projects. 

The results and analysis of this RFI shall not constitute any form of pre-qualification exercise and any formal procurement process will be undertaken in accordance with EU Procurement Law.
Nothing in this RFI, or any other engagements with Industry prior to a formal procurement process, shall be construed as a representation as to Leidos' ultimate decision in relation to the future requirement.",,,"Any region","33000000 ","Konstantin Nikolov",Konstantin.Nikolov100@teamleidos.mod.uk,"8 Monarch Ct,Bldg 8, Emersons Green",,BRISTOL,BS167FH,England,"+44 117 332 8575",,"Pre Hospital Emergency Care (PHEC) Ultrasound Devices- RFI (Final).DOCX ","https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/820f9446-f6d3-4c4e-864e-e979ed523147?p=@FQxUlRRPT0=NjJNT08=U ",,,,11/10/2019,NO,,Yes,No,No,,0,,,,,,,," ",

A flexible range of rations are required to meet the cognitive, nutritional and energy needs of the servicemen and women in the field. Due to the transient nature of military operations, routinely taking place all over the world, the ORP components will need to withstand a variety of climates and have an extended shelf life on delivery into the designated storage facility, which is currently planned to be the Defence Fulfilment Centre in Donnington, Shropshire. 
The ORP requirement has been split over four individual lots as follows: Lot 1 - Supply of Food Components and Sundry Items; Lot 2 - Supply of Packaging Materials; Lot 3 - Packing of ORP, and; Lot 4 - Supply of Survival Rations. 
The main ORP is the 24-Hr ORP, which typically consists of wet or freeze-dried main meal pouches (breakfast, lunch and dinner), snacks (chocolate bars, fruit/cereal bars, sweets and nuts, etc), fruit purees and powdered drinks, chewing gum, tea/coffee, whiteners, sugar, water sterilisation tablets, flameless ration heaters or windproof/waterproof matches, wet wipes, tissues and eating utensils.
Leidos is seeking to order food components, sundry items and packaging materials from suppliers (Lots 1 and 2) for delivery into a packing supplier for consolidation and onward delivery to the designated storage facility (Lot 3). The food components and sundry items have the requirement of a shelf life of not less than 24 months on delivery into the designated storage facility.
Survival Rations (Lot 4) are to be treated separately to this and will be procured as complete ration packs, delivered directly from the supplier to the designated storage facility. The survival rations have the additional requirement of a shelf life of not less than 48 months on delivery into the designated storage facility.
Leidos intends to award Lot 1 on an individual line item basis and Lots 2, 3 and 4 on a total Lot basis.

TIL services provide across England increased access and treatment for armed forces personnel approaching discharge and veterans with mental health difficulties. 
There are three elements to TILs - a transition service for those leaving the armed forces, an intervention service for veterans who have more complex presentations and would benefit from being seen by a clinician with expert understanding of armed forces life and culture; and a liaison service for those who do not have complex presentations but would benefit from treatment and support.

Building on the VMH - TIL service the VMH Intensive Service (VMH - IS) will provide an enhanced service for veterans with complex mental health problems that are attributable to military service, which have not been resolved earlier in the care / support pathway and require an intensive and assertive multi-disciplinary package of clinical and social interventions where a military culturally sensitive approach would assist the rapport and therapeutic outcomes for the patient.

Such environments include continuous vibration of varying intensity; high vertical acceleration loads (up to 100g); diverse weather conditions such as high winds, snow, severe temperature variation, and wet conditions; and severe restrictions on electromagnetic interference. Vehicles that encounter these operating conditions may be found in the military or aerospace sector in addition to the railway industry.

Musical instruments. Repair and maintenance services of musical instruments. Musical instruments and parts. Musical instruments. Repair and maintenance services of musical instruments. The Authority has a requirement for the supply and delivery of Musical Instruments, spares, consumables and associated products,sheet music and the Repair of musical instruments. The requirement will service the various musical bands and schools within the UK Armed Forces based both in the UK and overseas. It is intended to award a maximum number of eighty Enabling Contracts with various suppliers for generic groups of musical instruments and repair services. These generic groups are likely to include but not be limited to sound engineering equipment and technical support(also repair); percussion (also repair); woodwind (also repair); brass (also repair); fretted & electrical (also repair); string (also repair); bagpipes (also repair); miscellaneous (also repair); electrical packages (also repair); pianos (also repair); lighting engineering equipment (also repair); musical instruments for military schools (also repair); and the repair of musical instruments. The Authority reserves the right however to amend the number of groups and the content of the groupings prior to the Invitations to Tender being issued. It is likely that the Invitation to Tender will not include a definitive specification, but will ask potential suppliers to provide maximum price lists of Catalogues currently provided to the general public by bidders, with percentage discount figures detailed, while detailing a maximum man hour rate for their repair charges. The Authority's intention is that MOD customers will be able to approach all participating suppliers within the specific generic heading of the multi-participant framework agreement using mini-competitions. Orders will then be placed with the Contractor offering best value for money to the Authority, taking into account the award criteria detailed in our Invitation to Tender that will refer to this. Interested suppliers should express their interest only at this stage by forwarding their notification of interest to us with their full address, contact name, telephone number and email address. A Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) may be issued to interested parties though the Authority reserves the right to proceed to the Invitation to Tender stage without conducting a PQQ. All payments will only be made by the Government Procurement Card (GPC), therefore Tenderers must be VISA enabled by the contract commencement date if they are to receive a contract award.

The DE&S shall ""equip & support our Armed Forces for operations now & in the future."" DE&S is responsible for procuring & supporting all the equipment & services for the UK Armed Forces.To operate in harsh hostile & toxic environments whilst maintaining operational effectiveness is a challenge.The aim is to provide fit, form & function.Provide the user with IPE that is comfortable to wear ensuring the user can operate safely effectively & efficiently; whether on land sea or air (or a combination). The E-IPE challenge is to improve user effectiveness through a coherent & integrated clothing &protection system & bidders are to focus on 1 or more of the 7 key themes:
 •CBRN Protection – low burden,broad spectrum respiratory & dermal protection against toxic vapours,liquids & aerosols via integration with existing operational equipment
•Climatic/Environmental Protection – for integration of protective clothing against extremes of hot & cold e.g. on the upper deck of a carrier 
•Fire Protection – enhanced level of protection & reduction of the thermo physiological burden of the fire protection on board ships/carriers
•Industrial Protection – for personnel against for example hazardous materials or substances,noise etc 
•Blunt & Ballistic Protection–for integration of protective material into clothing without affecting the human factors(bulk,thermal burden,range of movement) 
•Enhanced Hand Protection–increase the capability/interoperability of gloves whilst providing increased functionality eg touch screen capability
•Novel Fitting Techniques – enable accurate measuring of the user for IPE to improve accuracy of armour positioning & optimise the sizing/fit.
The user needs a range of IPE that requires integration with other equipment. Innovative methods of integration of IPE would be beneficial to reduce the equipment burden on the user improve interoperability & potentially reduce inventory holdings.
The results assist DE&S to de-risk procurement & have broad exploitation for various specialist military users/industry/ civil/international markets.
Phase 1 therefore seeks proposals for proof of concept research into innovative technologies, materials/designs that optimise IPE deployed today in harsh, hostile & toxic environments.  
Phase 2 funding to develop working prototypes will be available for those projects that demo the greatest potential at the end of the Phase 1 contract.

DFID aims to help create a better governed, more peaceful & prosperous Burma that uses its increased wealth to reduce poverty and vulnerability, and build the human capability to take up opportunities within Burma and the region more broadly. Economic development is a major part of DFID’s offer in Burma as reflected in DFID Burma’s Operational Plan up to March 2016. Burma’s transition away from a military government has been accompanied by some economic reform. This has the potential to launch an economic transformation in Burma that could underpin sustainable poverty reduction by increasing productivity in agricultural, industrial and service sectors, and through movements of labour from lower productivity work to higher productivity work. To achieve this, Burma will need to reform across a range of areas. As part of DFID’s efforts to help reform in these areas, DFID has developed a new business case, ‘Business for Shared Prosperity in Burma’, for work up to 31 December 2020. This programme aims to improve economic opportunities for poor people in Burma by unlocking the potential of business by working in five areas: The regulatory and institutional environment for doing business; Financial sector; Infrastructure – financing and policy; Trade; and Inclusion and responsible business. DFID wishes to seek the services of a supplier to implement one of the delivery mechanisms of the Business Case, the Burma Enterprise Opportunity Facility. The facility will have two primary roles: provision of advice, technical assistance and capacity building; and issuing calls for proposals for innovative new projects that contribute to the objectives of the programme. We also envisage it will have a secondary role of assuming programme management on behalf of DFID for the Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business. DFID expects the supplier to be in place by the 1st of April at the latest and the contract will last until December 2020, with a 6 month inception phase. There will be two break points in the programme, one after the inception phase and one at the point of the third annual review in August 2018. At these break points, DFID reserves the right to stop, scale up or re-contract the facility. This is a Competitive Procedure with Negotiation as the nature of the services cannot be established with sufficient precision to permit the award of the contract using the Open or Restricted procedure.

"P/REF 00000317",Contract,"Historic England-National Heritage Protection Commissions",Closed,2016-01-14T15:54:41Z,"7253 A national planning overview of 19th century forts and associated fortifications","19th century forts and associated fortifications are some of our coast’s most distinctive monuments.  Architecturally and topographically they are striking places with clear historic significance often dominating their settings and localities.  They embody the changing nature of 19th century conflict as the technology of the industrial age was applied to warfare, fuelling great rivalry between Europe’s imperial powers.

Militarily most 19th century forts were declared obsolete in 1956, subsequently a number have been preserved as visitor attractions by English Heritage and other organisations.  A number have remained with the Ministry of Defence.  Others have been converted to residential and commercial uses, whilst others are derelict subject to decay and vandalism, and are registered as Heritage at Risk.

To ensure that more of these forts find new uses imaginative schemes based on best constructive conservation practices are required.  Increasingly, proposals are being put forward to convert forts to new uses; potentially involving some loss of historic fabric and later defensive features.  Forts are especially vulnerable to harm to their significance by virtue of changes to their settings.

This project is designed to provide a national overview of 19th century forts and associated fortifications in England.  It will identify which ones best exemplify evolution of military architecture, retain the best examples of features and fittings of various dates, and discuss the relative significance of later rearmament phases.  
The report will help to inform the work of Historic England and others to ensure well-informed and nationally consistent advice is available to those promoting and managing change, as well as would be developers.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has a requirement for the design, supply, delivery, and installation of safety equipment necessary to create a Laser Controlled Area (LCA) within one of the laboratory spaces used by the Nuclear Department. 

2.	The Nuclear Department owns a Class 4 Laser which can be used to image water flowing in an acrylic channel. The laser will be operated in the ND Irradiation Facility in a room which is shared with other scientific equipment. To allow simultaneous use of the facility, which is a requirement, a Laser Controlled Area must be established in accordance with JSP 390 – Military Laser Safety.   As this system will be operated in a laboratory environment, the most relevant section is JSP 390 Volume 1 Issue 3 Section 3.

3.	The expected engineered solution is described in paragraph 4 however, other solutions that satisfy the requirements will also be considered.

4.	It is expected that the most cost effective way to establish the LCA is to divide the room into two areas using a laser blocking material which must comply with IEC 60825-4:2006 in the pitched roof space and a curtain, complying to the same specification, hanging below the trusses. The curtain is to be attached at each end to walls by an interlocked connection. Above the curtain, a laser blocking material must be used to fill the spaces between trusses which support the roof. A new interlock system is also required to replace the existing obsolete system.  The new system should allow for a short, timed,  interlock override to allow safe ingress/egress from the area while the laser is functioning (often the laser will need to run continuously for hours at a time to generate data).  In addition, the new interlock should be connected to external signs which indicate the state of the laser to anyone outside the laser controlled area.  Personal Protective Equipment (Eyewear) is also required for 5 people (based on the instructor plus 4 students). 

5.	The MoD will require a full description and “rough” drawing to be submitted at the tender stage to identify the proposed solution and safety functionality.

6.	The Authority envisages a need for a brief site survey to enable potential suppliers to inspect the facility and compile accurate measurements of the installation site. This is planned to take place on 15 Feb 16 13:30.

7.	The Authority has the desire for delivery and installation by the end of Mar 2016

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has a requirement for the design, supply, delivery, and installation of safety equipment necessary to create a Laser Controlled Area (LCA) within one of the laboratory spaces used by the Nuclear Department. 2. The Nuclear Department owns a Class 4 Laser which can be used to image water flowing in an acrylic channel. The laser will be operated in the ND Irradiation Facility in a room which is shared with other scientific equipment. To allow simultaneous use of the facility, which is a requirement, a Laser Controlled Area must be established in accordance with JSP 390 – Military Laser Safety. As this system will be operated in a laboratory environment, the most relevant section is JSP 390 Volume 1 Issue 3 Section 3. 3. The expected engineered solution is described in paragraph 4 however, other solutions that satisfy the requirements will also be considered. 4. It is expected that the most cost effective way to establish the LCA is to divide the room into two areas using a laser blocking material which must comply with IEC 60825-4:2006 in the pitched roof space and a curtain, complying to the same specification, hanging below the trusses. The curtain is to be attached at each end to walls by an interlocked connection. Above the curtain, a laser blocking material must be used to fill the spaces between trusses which support the roof. A new interlock system is also required to replace the existing obsolete system. The new system should allow for a short, timed, interlock override to allow safe ingress/egress from the area while the laser is functioning (often the laser will need to run continuously for hours at a time to generate data).

SPARES CONTRACT FOR THE SUPPORT OF FIRE SUPPRESSION, NUCLEAR BIOLOGICAL CHEMICAL AND INFLATION AIRCRAFT EQUIPMENT


The Air Commodities Team, part of the UK Ministry of Defence, intends to award a contract extension to Kidde Graviner for the provision of a Support Contract which will contain; Repair, Spares, Post Design Services and Project Management for Kidde Graviner Fire Suppression, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical and Inflation Equipment for a maximum period of 18 months commencing 15 March 2016.

It is considered that this contract can be placed using the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice pursuant to Article 28(1)(e) of Directive 2009/81/EC (Regulation 16(1)(a)(ii) of the Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations (DSPCR) of 2011).  This is because Kidde Graviner are the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and Component Design Organisation for the equipment, and, bespoke tooling, test equipment and technical document sets are only available to Kidde Graviner.  Also, given the airworthiness regulations of the Military Airworthiness Authority (MAA) it would not be possible to ensure that another economic operator could be sufficiently qualified, within the timeframe, to undertake the requirement.  This would then result in the Authority being unable to fulfil safety requirements that must be adhered to, in order to ensure the safe operation of the associated aircraft within an Airworthy environment.  Achieving the required airworthiness standards required in this case, is an extremely complex process, and would mean that the enabling of another economic operator to be able to complete this work would invite substantial risks to the safety and interoperability of parts on multiple aircraft/airborne equipments required for the safe operations of the relevant aircraft.",,,"South East","24951220 ","Philip John",DESASAC-ComrclCM1a1a@mod.uk,"Air Commodities Team, Walnut 3C #1335, Nh1,","Walnut 3C #1335",Bristol,"BS34 8JH",UK,+443067987474,,,,"To view this notice, register as a supplier here:

The Members (as students are called), predominantly but not only from military backgrounds, are selected for their potential to reach the highest ranks of senior leadership and advisory posts in their own countries. As part of the core syllabus the RCDS runs two Strategic Exercises exposing its Members to the complexity of strategic analysis and formulation in two stages, enhancing their understanding of the requirements of strategy-making and developing their skills of strategic analysis and policy formulation.  
The requirement is to provide 2 separate but inter-linked exercises designed to exploit the Members’ understanding of the international system, focusing upon but not limited to the themes of international security, stability and prosperity. The exercises should be challenging and stimulating, demanding an examination of major geopolitical issues, regionally and globally in the near term, and provide the opportunity for the Members to engage in realistic and thorough strategic analysis and formulation and for their outputs to be tested in a realistic and developmental fashion.   In both exercises the Members have to demonstrate an understanding of and ability in: strategic analysis and formulation; decision making in a complex, dynamic near-real-time environment; communicating with and influencing other actors; developing and communicating a strategic narrative; operating imaginatively and persuasively under stressful, real-life conditions
The exercises are, in effect, mutually supporting in that they lead the Members, in sequence, through the business of strategic analysis and formulation before testing these against plausible real-world disruptive crisis management catalysts. The essential differences between the two exercises are that the first, Strategy Exercise 1 is a mentor led teaching evolution with a national strategy focus and sequential catalysts providing an initial deliberate and procedural approach to the principles and art of strategy-making. It should provide a coherent thread which can then be further developed throughout the remainder of the course and tested in the second evolution.  Strategy Exercise 2 is a more complex and dynamic member led undertaking requiring a global grand strategy focus with catalysts played concurrently after being introduced.

This competition is divided into two separate strands. 
1.	COTS - Mature “Commercial off the Shelf” (COTS) equipment, which is ready to be tested in a military context will be considered. 

2.	SBRI - Novel concepts and applications, including COTS offerings currently applied in non-defence areas that require R&D to make them applicable to defence needs are sought in order to provide innovative solutions.

Ultimately this will help MoD to de-risk procurement, generate evidence of capability gaps and inform requirements for future Equipment Programmes.
LVEx 2013 focuses on four key themes. Industry is invited to submit COTS technologies with innovative applications, or concepts that could provide solutions to any or all of the themes:
•	Mobility - We are looking for innovative ways to enhance the mobility of our vehicles over difficult terrain. Platforms of interest are those of our vehicles weighing 40 tonnes and below. 
•	Signature Reduction - We are interested in solutions for reducing the visual, acoustic and electronic signatures of our vehicle fleet i.e. how easy it is for our vehicles to be seen, heard or sensed.
•	Weight saving - We are very interested to see solutions which demonstrate how technology could reduce the weight of our wheeled vehicles. Platform types of interest include all those vehicles weighing 20 tonnes and below e.g. Ridgeback, Jackal, Coyote, Husky, etc.
•	Stowage - We invite industry to demonstrate innovative solutions for optimising internal and external stowage across our entire vehicle fleet. Specific problems include: stowage of personal kit, stowage of individual weapons due to the lack of a universal weapon rack, external Stowage of fuel, Electronic Counter Measures and water (all of which will also require protection).

Technologies developed and equipment shall be evaluated and the performance and effectiveness demonstrated through the established MOD Level A-B-C trials process:
•	Level A – System Performance evaluation (paper assessment/system demonstration) 
•	Level B – Fight-ability (soldier field tests)/System performance capture 
•	Level C – User Performance & System Effectiveness (vignette trials) 

This MOD call for proposals will launch vis SBRI (The Technology Strategy Board) on Monday 16 September 2013 and will close on 23 October 2013 at 12:00 hrs.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has a requirement for the design, supply, delivery, and installation of safety equipment necessary to create a Laser Controlled Area (LCA) within one of the laboratory spaces used by the Nuclear Department. 

2.	The Nuclear Department owns a Class 4 Laser which can be used to image water flowing in an acrylic channel. The laser will be operated in the ND Irradiation Facility in a room which is shared with other scientific equipment. To allow simultaneous use of the facility, which is a requirement, a Laser Controlled Area must be established in accordance with JSP 390 – Military Laser Safety.   As this system will be operated in a laboratory environment, the most relevant section is JSP 390 Volume 1 Issue 3 Section 3.

3.	The expected engineered solution is described in paragraph 4 however, other solutions that satisfy the requirements will also be considered.

4.	It is expected that the most cost effective way to establish the LCA is to divide the room into two areas using a laser blocking material which must comply with IEC 60825-4:2006 in the pitched roof space and a curtain, complying to the same specification, hanging below the trusses. The curtain is to be attached at each end to walls by an interlocked connection. Above the curtain, a laser blocking material must be used to fill the spaces between trusses which support the roof. A new interlock system is also required to replace the existing obsolete system.  The new system should allow for a short, timed,  interlock override to allow safe ingress/egress from the area while the laser is functioning (often the laser will need to run continuously for hours at a time to generate data).  In addition, the new interlock should be connected to external signs which indicate the state of the laser to anyone outside the laser controlled area.  Personal Protective Equipment (Eyewear) is also required for 5 people (based on the instructor plus 4 students). 

5.	The MoD will require a full description and “rough” drawing to be submitted at the tender stage to identify the proposed solution and safety functionality.

6.	The Authority envisages a need for a brief site survey to enable potential suppliers to inspect the facility and compile accurate measurements of the installation site. This is planned to take place on 15 Feb 16 13:30.

7.	The Authority has the desire for delivery and installation by the end of Mar 2016

Full details of the requirements for the Supply, Delivery and Installation of Safety Equipment for a Laser Controlled Area (LCA) will be included in the tender documents.

The MOD’s definition of Welfare is: ‘The provision of a widely recognised and accessible personal and community support structure that secures and improves the well-being of serving personnel and the Service community, is capable of adapting to societal, legislative and operational change and, in so doing, optimises the military capability and motivation of all Service men and women.’ 
RAF personnel and their families tend to lead a more mobile lifestyle than the civilian population, being posted to a different location every few years and often living in relatively remote areas. Mobility and the isolation of some units can separate RAF personnel and their families from their own extended family support mechanism. Moreover, Service families become separated from time to time, for periods of 6 months or more, when the Serving person is deployed abroad on operations or exercises. 

To take account of these factors, the RAF would like to continue to offer a contracted non-statutory Personal Support Service to the RAF Community that compliments other welfare support provided by the MOD, the RAF and Local Authority Statutory Agencies. This Advert is to seek interest from Industry for the provision of an output based non-statutory personal support and social work service to circa 32,000 RAF personnel, Regular and Reserves assigned to RAF administered units in the UK, as well as their families (spouses/civil partners and eligible children) in accordance with the contract Statement of Requirement. This will include the provision of confidential welfare support to Serving personnel and their families and specialist advice to unit staffs and station welfare casework committee meetings. The contract will be for five core years commencing 01 April 2017 to 31 March 2022, with a further two option years covering 01 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 and 01 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.

CCCC16A40,Contract,"Crown Commercial Service",Closed,2016-08-15T15:37:30Z,"CCCC16A40 - Provision of Finance Systems Future Strategy Workshops","The MoD has a significant Oracle footprint e.g. throughout Finance, Military and Civilian Personnel systems. This has been implemented organically over a number of years through a series of incremental, mainly stand alone, projects. This has led to a footprint that is segmented over several sets of hardware, which means that business process flows are inherently dependent upon a large amount of interfaces which impact the smooth flow of data through the system and add unnecessary complexity.

The approach taken to date meets business requirements, though as the eBusiness Suite (eBS) is spread across disparate servers there has been limited ability to utilise the Commercial off the Shelf (CotS) workflow through the integration of eBS. The net result of the current deployed architecture is that there are inefficiencies in the use of applications and therefore in business process.

The release 2 of Contracting Purchasing and Finance (CP&F) on 20th October 2016 will span the Finance and Procurement applications estate. This will create opportunities, both to improve Business Process flows through CotS workflow and also System Data flows through CotS integration. Please note that HR and Payroll will remain on their own hardware and continue to provide finance related transactions (e.g. accounting impact of staff costs) to the DFMS.

The Planning, Budget and Forecasting (PB&F) process is mainly supported by Enterprise Planning, COGNOS functionality. The PB&F application is large and complex, and there are many “off-system” processes (e.g. Excel), that support the application. In addition the business process that PB&F supports is complex with many hand-offs between Head Office, and other MoD Departments. This in turn compounds the issues created by an over complex application. 
Director General Finance has established a Finance Transformation Programme to review the existing finance business processes and identify improvements. The Financial Management Strategy aligns to industry best practise that the Department should seek to continually improve the finance systems in incremental steps to deliver the improvements in the business process flows.",,,"Any region","75000000 ","Crown Commercial Service",supplier@crowncommercial.gov.uk,"Floor 9, The Capital Building, Old Hall Street",,Liverpool,"L3 9PP",England,3450103503,https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/crown-commercial-service,"CCCC16A40 - Appendix C (2).docx CCCC16A40 - Appendix B Statement of Requirements (2).docx CCCC16A40 - Invitation To Tender Review.docx CCCC164A0 - Appendix A Terms of Participation.docx CCCC16A40 - Appendix E.xlsx CCCC16A40 - Appendix D Workshops (2).docx ",,"How to apply Instructions to Potential Providers:

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has a requirement for the design, supply, delivery, and installation of safety equipment necessary to create a Laser Controlled Area (LCA) within one of the laboratory spaces used by the Nuclear Department. 

2.	The Nuclear Department owns a Class 4 Laser which can be used to image water flowing in an acrylic channel. The laser will be operated in the ND Irradiation Facility in a room which is shared with other scientific equipment. To allow simultaneous use of the facility, which is a requirement, a Laser Controlled Area must be established in accordance with JSP 390 – Military Laser Safety.   As this system will be operated in a laboratory environment, the most relevant section is JSP 390 Volume 1 Issue 3 Section 3.

3.	The expected engineered solution is described in paragraph 4 however, other solutions that satisfy the requirements will also be considered.

4.	It is expected that the most cost effective way to establish the LCA is to divide the room into two areas using a laser blocking material which must comply with IEC 60825-4:2006 in the pitched roof space and a curtain, complying to the same specification, hanging below the trusses. The curtain is to be attached at each end to walls by an interlocked connection. Above the curtain, a laser blocking material must be used to fill the spaces between trusses which support the roof. A new interlock system is also required to replace the existing obsolete system.  The new system should allow for a short, timed,  interlock override to allow safe ingress/egress from the area while the laser is functioning (often the laser will need to run continuously for hours at a time to generate data).  In addition, the new interlock should be connected to external signs which indicate the state of the laser to anyone outside the laser controlled area.  Personal Protective Equipment (Eyewear) is also required for 5 people (based on the instructor plus 4 students). 

5.	The MoD will require a full description and “rough” drawing to be submitted at the tender stage to identify the proposed solution and safety functionality.

6.	The Authority envisages a need for a brief site survey to enable potential suppliers to inspect the facility and compile accurate measurements of the installation site. This is planned to take place on 15 Feb 16 13:30.

7.	The Authority has the desire for delivery and installation by the end of Mar 2016

As part of this programme, it has become apparent that the website could be better used - to improve the interaction between the council and its residents, visitors and businesses, as well as to improve the adherence to legal regulations. The Richmondshire district covers 509 square miles of North Yorkshire - one of the most sparsely populated district council areas in the country with its boundaries stretching from the River Tees to Cumbria. The area is predominantly rural in character and a large part is situated in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. Richmond is the largest town in the district with its Norman Castle, cobbled marketplace, famous Georgian Theatre Royal and elegant Georgian buildings. The district also boasts two other bustling market towns - Leyburn and Hawes, and many urban developments to the east - Catterick, Scotton, Hipswell, Colburn and Brompton on Swale. Reeth is also a service centre for the Upper Dales. Two main arterial roads - the A1 North/South and the A66 East/West five miles from Richmond - give easy nationwide access. Employment opportunities are good with light industry within and close to the district. It also contains the largest military establishment in the country, Catterick Garrison, which adds greatly to the economic wellbeing of the area. The area boasts good schools and health facilities and a range of excellent housing. The existing website richmondshire.gov.uk was developed almost three years ago and though it has served its purpose well it is now deemed to be out of date and have insufficient functionality. The domain name is owned by Richmondshire District Council. Internal research has shown that sections and customers would welcome improved functionality such as payment tools and interactive mapping systems from a new website. An intuitive content management system would assist in improving the customer experience when dealing with the council through the website.

This approach is intended to accelerate the subsequent release of an Invitation to Negotiate (ITN) to the pre-selected field of bidders once approval to proceed to competition has been confirmed. For planning purposes only the Authority is assuming that formal approval will be achieved in late January 2016.
      
      The UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) Armoured Vehicles Programmes (The Authority) has a possible future requirement to deliver a Challenger 2 Life Extension Project (CR2 LEP). The user requires the CR2 Main Battle Tank (MBT) Out of Service Date to be extended from 2025 to 2035, in order to continue to provide precision direct fire manoeuvre capability across a broad spectrum of operations. CR2 LEP seeks to address obsolescence issues to maintain main battle tank capability until 2035. This is a Category A Military Project (up to £700M inclusive of VAT, including initial logistic support).
      
      Subject to internal approvals, the Authority intends to conduct a Competitive Negotiated Competition under the Defence Security and Public Contracts Regulations 2011 with the intention of inviting a minimum of three tenderers. From these tenders the Authority intends to utilise Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) principles to down select to two Prime Contractors, with each being invited to independently undertake a 2 year Assessment Phase (AP) under contracts not to exceed the Authority's total AP budget of £42M inclusive of UK VAT. The ultimate aim of the competition will be to award a Demonstration, Manufacture and In-service Support (DMI) contract to the bidder which at the conclusion of the AP provides the most economically advantageous tender for the DMI contract.   
      
      During the AP the Authority will negotiate with the AP contractors under the Competitive Negotiated Procedure to refine their specific DMI proposals which will be evaluated at the conclusion of the AP. The Authority will then select a winner who, subject to a Main Gate investment decision, will deliver their proposed DMI solution in accordance with the terms included in the ITN and resolved during the AP. The ultimately successful DMI contractor will be required to formally undertake the role of Design Authority (DA) for the whole Platform. The timing for establishing formal DA status would be co-incident with the successful achievement of Critical Design Review during the D&M Phase.  
      
      Industry should note that the Invitation To Negotiate (ITN) will require the AP contractors to consider support options for any new to service items in conjunction with the Authority's primary Support provider (Babcock DSG Ltd), which is the existing provider of support to the Platform (and its common based platform variants) via existing Inventory and Repair Contracts.

      Original description: Requirement
      The Armed Forces People Programme (AFPP) requires ""stated preference"" modelling to understand the likely impact on recruiting & retention of Service (military) personnel of a no. of options for a new package of financial & non-financial rewards (the ""New Offer""), & of new contract terms that will allow Service Personnel to work part-time or to limit their liability to be moved around the country or overseas.
      Background
      The UK's 2015 Strategic Defence & Security Review (SDSR) undertook to ""enable our AF to work more flexibly, reflecting the realities of modern life"" (para 4.53), & to ""develop a new AF offer for new joiners"" (para 4.54). The AFPP's mission is to deliver the commitments made in SDSR. Its vision is to create ""a modern &inclusive AF which attracts, retains & values its people, in order to enhance operational capability, offering choice as to how they live & work providing a comprehensive & sustainable reward package that recognises commitments & service""
      Description of the modifications
      It was identified that Defence would gain considerable extra benefit from splitting the current planned survey (which supports 2 projects in the AFPP) into delivering two separate reports. This would result in additional cost and extension to original contract.
      Description of the economic or technical reasons and the inconvenience or duplication of cost preventing a change of contractor:

      To defend the A400M from hostile missile attack, the A400M is equipped with a number of  Countermeasure Dispenser Modules (CDMs), which is part of the Expendable Dispensing System (EDS), and mounted at strategic positions on the aircraft. 
      
      In order to realize the training potential of the CDM Trainer, CDMs at a minimum of 2 heights are required to replicate the 2 extremes that will be encountered on the live aircraft. Historically, all Armourer training is carried out on the live aircraft as no alternative training solution is available. 
      The introduction of a simulated training device will reduce the probability of damage to the aircraft, plus increase the availability for Trade Group 1 personnel to train in the safe handling of the EDS decoy equipment and materials.
      Therefore, there is a requirement to provide a representative training device that will be more efficient than using the live aircraft.  A representative training device will allow the Armourers to practice, load and unload drills along with the ability to train for an event of a partially ejected flare. 
      The training device is not required to perform the same function as the 'real world' CDM or required to be either Part145 or airworthy compliant.  The CDM training device must be the same dimensions and include the ability to connect a dummy electrical connector in the same manner and type as the live aircraft.
      
      Provide a Training structure that will replicate the Countermeasure Dispenser Modules (2x) found at the lowest point and (2x) found at the highest point on the A400M aircraft.
      Provide the ability to lower the highest CDM trainer to ground level by simple mechanical means and without the need for manual handling or working at height.
      Deliver a training device that will resist all weather conditions experienced within the RAF Brize Norton location.
      Securely position the CDM training devices to allow access by a mechanical/motorised working at height platform and without interference to the Cargo Hold Trainer and any ongoing training activity within the 24Sqn A400M Training School compound.
      
      Experience of working with the UK Military and also experience of providing training aids or similar engineering works.
      
      Delivery of Contract: The CDM trainer will need to be delivered, site accepted and Ready For Use (RFU), by 1st February 2018 This date is timed to ensure that the CDM trainer is in place to meet the operational needs.
      
      The Deadline for Expressions of Interest (EOI) is the 15/09/2017, any potential provider who submits an EOI shall receive a Statement Relating to Good Standing which should be submitted by 10 am on 22/09/2017.

      The importance of cyber security resilience and the vulnerability of a range of countries across Europe and Central Asia to both state & non-state based cyber threats have become increasingly clear in MOD's defence engagement over the past year. In the Western Balkans especially, recent high level political engagement has raised concerns that hostile states may seek to exploit inadequate or non-existent cyber security infrastructure for its own political ends. Indeed, in Montenegro, the penetration & deactivation of the MoD's IT systems formed part of an alleged coup attempt against the incumbent government in 2016. 
      Our cyber security engagement in the Western Balkans, Central Asia & South Caucasus are therefore primarily a resilience building exercise. From the relatively low starting point in cyber security resilience this training initiative will aim to support the targeted countries (Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Georgia, Albania, Macedonia, and Kazakhstan) in: building a solid knowledge base of cyber threats; putting in place robust cyber security strategies; & showcase UK best practice. This will all be achieved with a view to developing a longer-term cyber security relationship with the region. 
      Objectives - To provide the training course delegates with a clear understanding of how an effective cyber organisation works through sharing UK best practice.
      To ensure delegates understand how and what type of cyber-attacks occur, the impacts they have, and how to protect and build resilience into their infrastructure.
      To ensure delegates recognise the value of a cyber security strategy and how best to develop and implement such a strategy.
      Provide Wider Europe Policy (WEP) with recommendations for how each country can best take forward cyber resilience plans. 
      Details -The course will last for 5 days, for up to ten countries, Each country will be limited to 2 delegates (military &/or civilian). Course will be delivered in English. 
      The targeted countries will be at different levels of building their cyber resilience.There should be a significant practical element to the course, ideally whereby participants can work on a scenario devised by the provider, potentially in the form of a wargame. English will not be the first language of the delegates so it will be important that the course is delivered in an interactive, hands-on manner to enable the delegates to fully engage in the course. 
      In addition to delivering the actual course, time will be required to develop & confirm the course content & produce appropriate materials. The date for the course is still tbc - likely to be in early Jan 18.

The National Army Museum wishes to appoint a suitably experienced mount making company to manufacture and install the object mounts for items to be displayed in a special exhibition at the National Army Museum in Chelsea for an exhibition opening in March 2018.

Included as separate documents with this tender brief are:

•	Object Full Mount Schedule

1.	Extent of Works

The scope of this mounts package consists of a number of different types of mount to be found in the schedule.  The Contractor shall provide everything necessary for the mounting and completion of the Works.

General Comments

The schedule is separated into the following groups. This is to enable the contractor to appropriately assess costs and time allocation for the different type of mounts:

1.	Objects requiring a mount
2.	Objects requiring a plinth
3.	Objects requiring a 2D mount 
4.	Objects requiring suspension

Objects inside the showcases will either be positioned on glass shelves requiring self-supporting mounts or secured directly on to the display case base or back boards, both of which will be made from Z-MDF. Full display case specifications will follow after the appointment has been made. If known the mount colour has been specified in the schedule. 

Three objects will be on open display, one of which will need anchoring to a plinth and two of which will require suspension from the ceiling. 

Access to Objects

The objects are currently located at combination of the NAM storage facilities in Stevenage and the lending venues (Royal Marines Museum, Combined Military Services Museum and the Airborne Assault Museum). As a high proportion of the objects will be on loan it is expected that the contractor will need to visit the lending venues as well as NAM. This will need to be considered when the object assessments, mount discussions and mount making are sequenced in the mount making programme.

Contractors are to note that there is a small workshop space at the main NAM off-site storage facility in Stevenage, which is also where the Collections Care and Standards Team are based. At this workshop Perspex could be worked, but there is currently no hot works permit or heat/extraction for working metal. 

The contractor will need to describe their approach to the mount-making process including object assessments, measurement taking, mount making, checking the mount with the object prior to transfer to the museum site, and allowance within the tender price and time allocation for on-site installation of object mounts. NAM will need to see a breakdown from the contractor of the allowance for on-site work during object installation and what the approach of the successful contractor would be to making changes to mounts during this period.",,,London,"92520000 ","Ms Vicky Singleton",vsingleton@nam.ac.uk,"National Army Museum Royal Hospital Road",,London,"SW3 4HT",England,"020 7881 2469",nam.ac.uk,"Special Exhibition Mounts Specification.docx Object Full Mount Schedule.xlsx ",,,05/01/2018,16/03/2018,17/12/2017,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,5000,0,,,,,,,"CompetitiveQuotationNonOJEU ",

Within the Ludgershall area, it has been identified that there is a need for the development of a new two form entry primary school including a thirty-place nursery to be located on a circa 2.3-hectare parcel of land provided by the MOD via a Section 106 Agreement within the site of the former Corruna Barracks in Ludgershall. The requirement is that the new school and nursery is operationally ready to accept pupils by September 2019 which is the purpose of this tender opportunity.",,,"South West","45214000 ","Genna A'Court",genna.acourt@wiltshire.gov.uk,"Wiltshire Council","County Hall, Bythesea Road",Trowbridge,"BA14 8JN",England,"+44 1225712680",http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/,,,,26/06/2018,01/06/2019,30/04/2018,NO,,Yes,No,No,Works,5400000,5400000,26/06/2018,5400000,"[Dawnus Construction Holdings Ltd|Swansea SA7 0AP|NONE||No|No]",,01/07/2018,01/09/2019,"Restricted ",

Teaching in FE offers a sustainable career which utilises the expert technical knowledge and skills acquired and developed whilst serving within the military. An area of focus of Gatsby's work includes supporting the provision of technical education and the provision of subject specialist mentors to support this area of focus.
Therefore, the primary function of this programme is to deliver a joint Gatsby/Foundation funded scheme, backed by MoD activity, implementing a programme of support and mentoring aimed at meeting the above key objectives of each of the stakeholders involved in establishing this programme for a minimum of 210 service leavers.

As part of this programme, it has become apparent that the website could be better used - to improve the interaction between the council and its residents, visitors and businesses, as well as to improve the adherence to legal regulations. 
 
The Richmondshire district covers 509 square miles of North Yorkshire - one of the most sparsely populated district council areas in the country with its boundaries stretching from the River Tees to Cumbria. The area is predominantly rural in character and a large part is situated in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. 
 
Richmond is the largest town in the district with its Norman Castle, cobbled marketplace, famous Georgian Theatre Royal and elegant Georgian buildings. The district also boasts two other bustling market towns - Leyburn and Hawes, and many urban developments to the east - Catterick, Scotton, Hipswell, Colburn and Brompton on Swale. Reeth is also a service centre for the Upper Dales. 
 
Two main arterial roads - the A1 North/South and the A66 East/West five miles from Richmond - give easy nationwide access. Employment opportunities are good with light industry within and close to the district. It also contains the largest military establishment in the country, Catterick Garrison, which adds greatly to the economic wellbeing of the area. The area boasts good schools and health facilities and a range of excellent housing. 
 
The existing website 
richmondshire.gov.uk was developed almost three years ago and though it has served its purpose well it is now deemed to be out of date and have insufficient functionality. The domain name is owned by Richmondshire District Council. 
 
Internal research has shown that sections and customers would welcome improved functionality such as payment tools and interactive mapping systems from a new website. An intuitive content management system would assist in improving the customer experience when dealing with the council through the website. 
 
Richimondshire District Council are advertising this tender via YORtender and would require prospective supplier to submit any tenders via this portal. 
 
The contract will be initially for 3 years with an optional 2 x 12 months' extension at the Councils discretion.
